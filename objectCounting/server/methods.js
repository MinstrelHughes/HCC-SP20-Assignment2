				1: "This is an idea whose time has not arrived. Perhaps if one has a teeny tiny vehicle then this may work out. First of all, you have to purchase micro-fiber towels per the instructions. Be sure to get lots of them. You are instructed to do one panel at a time - spray, wipe and buff. Supposedly you will save 80 - 120 gallons of water and eliminate toxic runoff (apparently referring to the soapy water). I HAVE NEVER USED ANYWHERE NEAR THAT MUCH WATER TO WASH MY CAR. With eco touch I am left with a whole slew of micro-fiber towels that would end up in a landfill because I don't know how to recycle dirty towels.I believe that eco touch has a problem with \"truth in advertising\". I can see using this for minor cleaning such a a deposit left by a bird or an insect meeting its demise on my vehicle. But, to wash the entire car is best done with a bucket, hose, sponge and chamois cloth. Or, take it to a car wash.",
				2: "I removed the driver's side wiper blade from my pick-up. I was unable to install the ACDelco with any of the adapters that were furnished. I went to the Amazon web site and entered the information for my vehicle and the response was that this wiper blade was a match for my vehicle. So, it must be just me that can't get it installed and I need to try a different approach.I took my Frontier back to the Nissan dealer where I purchased the vehicle. I asked the dealer to install the wiper blade and while there go ahead and change the oil and rotate the tires. The dealer did the oil and tire thing as usual but was unable to get the ACDelco blade to work. I asked him to put my original blade back on, which he did, and I recycled the ACDelco. Against the advice I did look this gift horse in the mouth and it had no teeth.",

				4: "I've been using this filter for the 12 years that I've owned my Camry, and have been using Fram filters long before that.  It works just like it should; as far as I know this is the best filter on the market.  The sandpaper-like grip has me committed to this brand.  It allows me to change the filter on my car without any tools, and I cannot exaggerate the convenience of that one feature alone. Some people have commented on the quality of the filter based on what it looks like on the inside.  While it's a natural tenancy to judge products by the way they look, I wouldn't give it much value.  The only way to properly judge an oil filter is to run lots of dirty oil through it and see if it does its job.  Consumer Reports did this a long, long time ago and Fram came out on top.  I'm sure the product has changed since then, and I'm not aware of more recent studies.  All I can say is that I've used this brand for more than a decade and have never had any problems with the filter.",
				5: "I purchased these love-beam headlight bulbs to replace the stock bulbs in my 2003 Toyota 4Runner; per the Amazon parts tool.  I'd never replaced the bulbs myself, but after a quick 'how to' on Google, I easily replaced the bulbs myself and was pleased with the illumination they provided. The light is visibly whiter than the stock bulbs they replaced, and seem about 30% brighter with good coverage to the sides as well as the front of the vehicle.The claim by Philips that these bulbs provide 'up to' 50% more width and 50' longer beam is debatable, but I would imagine that depends a lot on your driving conditions, age of your vehicle, type of vehicle and similar. A single OEM bulb was about six dollars, so for a little bit more per bulb I believe I installed a much better product. I'm pleased with my purchase and would recommend these bulbs to others who are looking for brighter, whiter low-beam headlights at the right price.",
				6: "Great towel!  It is larger than typical microfiber \"cloths\" (about the size of 4 small cloths) and is about the size of a regular hand towel.  I have not really seen a product like this - the microfiber is very thick and plush, almost spongy, so it absorbs an incredible amount of water.  The sewing on the edges does not cause scratching.  The towel works great for drying a car with no streaking.  I also plan to try for home cleaning (eg, washing/drying windows and floors) and general outdoor use.  For home cleaning, I may buy another and try to cut into smaller cloths.  I find that many of these automotive products translate well into multi-use.  I have been satisfied with all Griot's Garage products I have tried so far. Fabric content: 80% polyester / 20% polyamide.  Machine wash warm and dry, no bleach, fabric softener or ironing.  Made in China.",
				7: "When it came time to install this wiper, my husband and I were ready to come outside and I stopped to put on a sweatshirt. In that minute-long gap, my husband had the old wiper blade off and the new one, so needless to say, install was a snap.These wipers provide a really smooth wiping action with light to moderate rainfall (I haven't hit a bucketfuls of rain scenario yet) and are quite effective at cleaning with the automatic windshield cleaner. The only issue -- and it is a minor one -- is that in the lower right hand corner of the passenger side of the car (where this was installed) the wiper leaves a small sliver of area that it doesn't cover which is peculiar given the smooth arc it creates on the rest of its path. All and all those, this wiper works well (I don't rely on the corner while driving) and the all-in-one profile is sleek!",
				8: "Most eco friendly products seem to have some drawbacks, unpleasant smell or texture or being  very expensive. These products seem to work very well on my \"new to me\" SUV. There is a great windshield cleaner that you can spray on to remove those huge bugs that seem to leave an impermeable deposit on the windshield. If I am getting gas and have a particularly nasty spot, I spray with this and it disappears along with the normal grime that you can get with the sponge and squeegee. It has a dashboard protector which I found handy because this vehicle came with scratches as if a small dog was trying to get to the windshield. The scratches disappeared with just a spray and a wipe. The kit includes an all purpose cleaner which I use in the car seat, an upholstery/carpet cleaner and \"surprise\", a really good leather cleaner. As the owner of several saddles, I have been using leather cleaners for fifty years and this is good stuff. The seats look like new when I am done.",
				9: "I've bought SMDs countless times on amazon and I want the whitest SMD possible. I was replacing the gauge cluster bulbs in a '98 Camry and needed a few more. I wanted small ones with less SMDs since I wasnt sure about the depth for the bulb so I figured this kit would be fine. To be blunt, they work, well most of them. Some of them had the top SMD blown out but it wasnt too noticeable in the cluster. They all turned on and the cluster looks a lot better but not much brighter than the factor bulbs. The Jtechs are also in the 8000k range which I don't like. 8000K is white with a lot of blue, probably the closest thing to a solid blue LED. I definitely do not recommend these for license plate or parking lights since they'll attract too much attention and aren't very bright. If youre replacing gauge cluster bulbs then they'll be fine.",
				10: "I originally purchased the Deltran Battery Tender Jr. (021-0123) to keep the battery on my vehicle charged as it&#8217;s advertised of being capable of doing so on the packaging. This battery tender did not charge the battery on my car within the 72 hour window and turned off (Has a built-in timer). I called Deltran (877-456-7901) and was told by customer service that the Deltran Battery Tender Jr. was too small to use on a car/truck battery and that I should have purchased the Deltran Battery Tender Plus. I eventually purchased the Deltran Battery Tender Plus (021-0128) and the Deltran 12.5 ft. extension lead (DBT081-0148-12). The Deltran Battery Tender Jr. works fine on my walk behind lawn mower with electric start and should be fine for anything with a small battery. I would suggest that you purchase the Deltran Battery Tender Plus so you can have the option of using it on more equipment. Deltran should change the label on the Deltran Battery Tender Jr. if it&#8217;s not really intended for car/truck batteries. Check out batterytender.com for Deltrans&#8217; complete line.",
				11: "I used the Meguiar's Headlight Lens Correction kit on my 1993 mini-van. The headlights were very foggy and the lights appeared dim. The kit did not restore it to 'new' but there is a significant improvement, about 75% better. On a 20 year-old vehicle, I am pleased with this result. The cleaning process took about 45 minutes. It doesn't require any special tools, everything is included in the box. There are four types of sanding pads, a polisher and a protectant, just need to add a little water to wet the pads. Be prepared to use some muscle while scrubbing. The only improvement I can recommend is that the kit should come with extra sandpaper or larger pieces so that it can be used on more than one car. There is ample polish left over and a very nice reusable cleaning cloth included with the kit. Overall, compared to the cost of a new headlight, this is a good deal.",
				12: "I used this product for the first time the other day. I hadn't been able to wash my car for over two months. It was filthy, to say the least. Even after a thorough wash there was still gunk on the paint. The clay itself is a very generous size, and the container is a nice addition. The spray detailer is also of a generous size, and while this doesn't really matter, it smells good too. In my opinion, this clay was a bit more aggressive than Mother's or Meguiar's. Although a microfiber cloth would have been a welcomed addition to this kit, the spray and clay are excellent in and of themselves. ALL the stuck on crud was removed after I clay bared my car with this product. All around great product. One tip, even with the container, the clay is rather sticky and will stick in there so I wrap it in parchment paper so it won't stick to anything (wax paper doesn't work nearly as well).",
				13: "I purchased two Bosch Evolution blades for my 2007 Hyundai Accent on 02/07/2014. Today, 05/19/2014, I finally gave up and replaced them. I have never had wiper blades that performed this poorly. There was almost no contact with the windshield on either side. They left haze and streaks and would spatter water about requiring incessant re-wiping of the windshield to get it to clear. This, the 22&#34; blade frequently chattered and hopped when there was only light moisture. I've never had new beam style wiper blades do that. I purchased these Evolution blades because last season I had a set of Bosch's Clear Advantage on the car and really liked the way they performed. Unfortunately none of the local stores had them in stock when I needed new blades so I thought spending more on these supposedly better Evolution blades would be a no-brainer. With less than 3,000 miles and three months of use I just threw away thirty bucks because I trusted a company to make a quality product. Highly dissatisfied.",
				14: "These seemed like a nice, cheap way to darken up our RV for sleeping in, and keep out unwanted solar heating. However, we really want and need them most when it's hottest outside. We've had 100 degree weather this week. I installed these on the ceiling vents, by simply peeling the backing off some Velcro tabs and sticking it between the mat and the vent box. Unfortunately after the sun had been beating on ours for about an hour, the Velcro glue let go, and the covers fell off. The Velcro stuck to the vent, but it pulled off the shiny chrome covers. It sticks fine when it's cool, but that defeats the purpose of being a \"sunshield\". Now I'm concerned that the glue will take the finish off the ceiling if I pull the Velcro tabs back off. I wanted these to be easily removable. Good idea, but I don't know how you fix that without screwing them down or something else that will leave permanent, unsightly residue or hardware. ???Buy the vent shade \"pillow\" style Camco 45192 RV Sunshield Vent Insulator instead. Don't use the included Velcro tabs, just stuff them up in the vent and they'll stay.",
				15: "Good stuff, but thanks and no-thanks. Due to the DOT requirements, the \"Super blue\" is no longer available. I used to alternate the \"blue\" and the \"amber\" between brake fluid flushes. The different contrasting colors were especially helpful when you flush out the old fluid replacing with the new ones and knowingly there is no guess work because when the color changes while you a bleeding the line, you know the old fluid were purged, replaced with the new ones. Well, thanks to the DOT requirements, with no valid reason, they banned such a distinctive useful feature just because they specify that the color for brake fluids from now on should either be amber or clear. I thought DOT's function is to ensure safety issues, surely their interests in cosmetic preference is running amok and goes over and beyond their purpose. Thanks to all the Ralph Nadar wannabees...running that department into a typical government dumb failure.",
				16: "Knowing that red items might bleed, I decided to put the towels in a sink-full of water to see what happened. Oh, my gosh, these towels faded badly. I left them soak a while, wrung them out, added more hot water & let them soak again...they faded more. I repeated this process one more time, then wrung the towels out & let them dry. I decided to handwash a couple of them, so I soaped them up & ran hot water on them. I couldn't believe that the water was even redder than before. I'm wondering if they'll ever stop fading. The two I handwashed were used for general house cleaning. They did a good job dusting, absorbing water & keeping surfaces lint free. I will dedicate some for glassware use but might bleach them to hopefully stop the color bleed. Because of their waffle weave texture, the towels measure about 1/2 shorter all the way around than advertised. They can be stretched to the advertised size. Zwipes Waffle Weave towels perform like microfiber should, but I cannot recommend the burgundy color.",
				17: "If you're familiar with the red flashing LED bicycle tailights seen on so many bikes these days, then you'll understand whan I say that this unit is essentially a one-LED version of those lights. Yes, it's visible from a good distance away, but only if you're directly behind it; the lens that focuses the light from the LED concentrates it over perhaps 10 degrees. The base has a magnet it it that will allow it to stand up on the roof of a car, assuming the roof is metal, which is still true for most cars. So as a road flare, it's better than nothing, but still nowhere near as visible as a traditional flare, or just putting on on your car's four-way emergency flashers. So what use it is? It might be useful as a rescue device, for signaling, or locating someone in the woods at night (if they had the presence of mind to bring it along with them). Given the low price, it might be worth experimenting with.",
				18: "I tried to charge my car battery and it showed 12v at 40% so after four hours it showed 12v at 100%. I removed the cables and after 30 minutes it showed 12.1v at 52% and after two hours it was at 100%. Let it sit again and it was 12.3v at 71%. I tested the voltage at times while charging and it never went above 12.5v. I do not believe that this is a reliable charger so I returned it for a older model SE-5212A. I have used Midtronics products so I understand the microprocessors and there quirks but nothing beats the old tried and true charges that have metal cases and transformers. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this it's junk. P.S it's 3/12 Amp not 3/6/12 Amp. This charger works if you have a battery that is weak but if your battery is under 9 volts you have to keep unplugging it and start over and over until it reaches a threshold to maintain it. The cooling fan does not run all the time and the unit over heats and then I would have to let it cool down and start over again.",
				19: "This is a little red flashlight, period.  Yes, the red light is bright, and yes, it blinks if you set it to do so.  But this would NEVER take the place of a real flare under any circumstances. DO NOT buy this to replace the flares you should carry in your car emergency kit!!!! Most flashlights have the light beam coming straight out of the end of the tube.  This one has the light coming off the side, like a beacon or lighthouse.  It can ONLY be viewed from straight on!  While a flare puts out intense light in all directions (like a sparkler) this little flashlight only puts out light in one direction - the direction you have faced the beam.  DO NOT BUY, except as a toy, or as a hiking signal light - I have given it two stars for it being at least that useful. Flare?  No way.",
				20: "I installed a set of 8 ACCEL coils into my 2005 Ford F-150 with 5.4L V-8 motor and 72,000 miles.  I did the coils at the same time as renewing the spark plugs, mainly because of the labor savings.  The ACCEL coils fit as good as the OEM ones.  Between the new spark plugs and the coils, the engine does feel smoother at idle, and seems to be more responsive at acceleration.  ACCEL uses high quality materials that should stay within spec longer, and has experience in developing high performance products.  And, more importantly, ACCEL has quality controls to match the electrical characteristics requirements with precision and consistency -- which is the key to a good coil.  Since any gain in horsepower is the same as a gain in mileage, and with the high price of gasoline, then it makes sense to invest in this small upgrade.  It is also good to look at those yellow coil packs on the engine.",
				21: "I actually tested this protestant on my hub cap because I don't have a garage and the instructions say to apply the protectant ONLY in 65-plus degree conditions (we've been getting mid-fifties temps most part of the day). The 3M Paint Defender System goes on hazy but dries COMPLETELY CLEAR to provide a tough and invisible barrier against rocks and debris for the parts of your vehicle vulnerable to chips and scratches. The kit comes with everything you need: microfiber cloth, wax, spray canister of protectant, spray trigger, and plastic car cover. It's important to follow the instructions to the tee! CAUTION: make sure to spray on at least 3 even coats of the protectant. This ensures that the protectant dries and cures into a tough and tear-resistant film that peels off clean when it comes time to remove it. If you haven't applied enough coats, the resulting film may be so thin and prone to tearing that when you try to remove it later on, you will end up picking at and peeling off tiny scraps at a time -- a nightmare! Err on the side of being overly liberal with spraying the protectant on! Good luck.",
				22: "First, I must note this really is a veryu cheaply made item.  I verified that the batteries are a very very tight fit (what were they thinking) but they just make it in with close to zero tolerance.  I bought this at Camping World nearby where, at the time, it was about the same price as here (15.55). They have since lowered the price on amazon.  It was quiet and seemed rather stable and I just did a few hours testing.  All seemed well and contrary to other reports, the unit never got hot.  Is it possible that although the units are the same model number that the ones being sold at Camping World are not as defective as the ones being sold at Amazon?  I asked the long time woirker there who claimed they never had a return on this unit and the reviews at the Camping world website were consistently positive, unlike the reviews here at Amazon.  Makes you wonder what is up with all this? I as yet have no longer term experience with the unit and if I run into problems worth mentioning, I will update this review.",
				23: "Don't believe the ad statement 'heavy duty cord' translates into 'heavy duty' anything, other than maybe rubber insulation. THIS IS FOR LOW-POWER ITEMS ONLY!!! It is 20-AWG wire inside, barely enough wire diameter to run a 5-watt speaker. If you think you are going to plug in a tire inflator, a 1,000,000 candle spotlight, etc., you are SADLY MISTAKEN. This is NOT, repeat NOT heavy duty. It is a crime that the wire AWG (American Wire Gauge) is not listed in the specs. Otherwise, you would know that plugging in a heavy amperage load is either going to burn this up in a split second, or turn it into a heater coil and set your car on fire when you try. If you want to charge a cell phone, an iPad, etc. on it, go ahead, no problem. But the problem is, most people buy an extension cord for a cigarette lighter to do something with a heavy amp load outside of the vehicle. This WILL NOT support a heavy amp load.",
				24: "At least I obtained Lexol's Premium Tire Shine Spray through Amazon's Vine program, because I would have been greatly disappointed had I paid the going price. The main issue is that Stoner, Meguiar, and Mother's all make superior products, and all of them are readily available at auto supply stores.  The spray nozzle on the Lexol product produces an awfully wide spray, which tends to lead to waste and having to clean the overspray off your wheels when used in the wide setting.  On the narrow setting, there's still a fair amount of run-off waste.  The biggest problem is that this product is not nearly as shiny as its competitors, nor does it seem to last appreciably longer.  If you're in a pinch, Lexol's Premium Tire Shine Spray is ok, but if you can find one of the three competitors listed above at a comparable price, then think twice about this product.",
				25: "This is the best way to change your oil. I can change my oil wearing a tuxedo with no mess, thanks to these pumps.Get the 7400 instead of the 7201. It's more reliable because it has fewer parts (such as the bidirectional pumping). It's also cheaper. Although I wish these were 10 quart models to hold an entire Mercedes oil change, none of the Mityvac models are, so you will have to empty it halfway through. A good way to tell if your extractor works properly on your car is to pump all the oil and then pull the drain plug. If nothing comes out, your car is empty and the pump worked. If oil comes out, the pump didn't get it all and you probably should drain rather than pump your car. In theory the pump can get more out than draining, since it goes to the bottom of the pan, whereas the plug typically has a lip that prevents it from draining all the oil.",
				26: "I'm not shocked that there were no wires, even though the picture shows wires.  But I am surprised that the dust cover - which appears to be integral in the picture - is not included.  All that's in the package is the clamp itself and some self-drilling sheetmetal screws.  Maybe I'll check back some day and see that the picture has been changed or the description has been updated to reflect reality, in which case I'll change the number of stars.  But for now, I'm knocking two stars off for the deceptive ad, and another star for the product really being a fairly cheap piece.  In my opinion, the piece isn't a great value; the price is at best only \"fair\".  And yeah, I know, we're not reviewing prices.  But it's a cheaply-made product which lacks finish; I think the bottom side could've been solid instead of having the exposed ribbing, and I think the included screws (which appear to at least be stainless) should've come with appropriately-sized washers to distribute the load on the plastic.",
				27: "First I must say I hate purchasing tools that only do one thing...(uni-tasker).  I purchased this socket tool, becouse I had to.  Not becase I wanted to, but quickly found out I need another socket to turn it... and here's the kicker.  The socket is bigger then standard set 19mm or 3/4!  So you have go out and purchase a 15/16 or 24mm socket, which is a huge socket.  I will never use this socket unless I own a diesel truck.  Add that to the cost of the wrench. So about 8 dollars for the socket and the price of tool, just to get started.  The oil filter wasn't on too tight, so the cheaper plastic tool worked out just fine for me.  The 24mm socket stays on the aluminum tool and should ship like that.  Waste of time and money for a tool that only does one task....",
				28: "It works good just as most of the reviewers have said, but the one I got stunk very badly when I took it out of the box. The smell is similar to the smell that I have found on shoes, tools and other products that came from China (appears to be something in the plastic/glue they use). I'm a smoker so my smeller is not too good, but I can smell this thing from across the room. I'm surprised, because I read a lot of the reviews before I bought this thing and I don't remember anything about it smelling, so maybe I got a bad one. I've had this thing out of the box for several days now, but the smell is just as powerful as the day I opened the box for the 1st time. I'll be keeping it because it will be used mostly outdoors were it don't smell as badly, but I won't be buying another or recommending this thing!",
				29: "In this dry climate where I live, I really ought to take more care of my leather furniture.  I don't condition the leather often enough.  Today, I used Leather Nova leather conditioner and realized how revitalized my leather can look.  I was only intending to condition a few chairs, but I'm going back to do the seats in my car and some more chairs I'd skipped. The conditioner comes with an applicator sponge. I applied it to clean leather, waited an hour, then buffed it off. We're supposed to use a microfiber cloth for that (not included). I could see the leather drink in the solution as I rubbed it in. When I was done, everything shined like new with a suppleness that wasn't there before. This is definitely the most superior leather conditioner I've ever used. It takes a little more work (no cleaning nor buffing required of the others), but the difference is remarkable. This product was provided for review by Leather Nova.",
				30: "This is one of those, \"You just never know\" type devices that gives your or your loved ones a little bit of peace of mind.  I rate it up there with smoke detectors and fire extinguishers. The main reason for me to decrease my score is because the LED flashlight is a poor design in that it is too easy to press and turn on by accident, in your pocket or perhaps a purse. Also, the size of this thing is really large that you wouldn't want to put your keys plus a 3\" x 2\" device in your pocket!  Better yet, take off the fuzzy dice and attach this thing to your rear view mirror!  Just yank on it to use it in an emergency!  (It's designed to slide out easily) This is 5-in-1 which includes a personal alarm, but that too, is a bit too easy to trigger, nor do I think effective versus yelling, which your basic instinct will make you do anyways. Overall, this is a good buy for peace of mind to hang on your rear view mirror for easy use when you may need it.",
				31: "I got the Bi-Xenon 10000k kit for my 2001 Ford Taurus and they are amazing. I had zXe silver star halogens before and they weren't that bright and had a yellow tint to them. Not impressed because the zXe's are supposed to be top notch. Then I said screw it lets just go HiD. The reviews on the Kensun kit were so good I had to get these. Installation was a bit rough, but once I figured everything out it was fine. The 10000k's are white with a slight blueish tint. The product description says they're 2-3 times brighter than halogens. No lie, they're seriously bright. I can see all the signs and roads clearly now! I recommend this to everyone. I took off my rating not for the HID's but because I sent an email to customer service and never got a reply. The other reason was that packaging, one of the bulbs and ballast were not even in the foam socket when I opened it up, luckily nothing was damaged.",
				32: "I have a car that is not used regularly and am always concerned about the battery not having a charge when its needed. I've been using a float charger on it (a Battery Tender) which has been working out great. However, the charger doesn't give me any feedback as to the overall health of the battery. This device solves that problem. It is very easy to use even if you're not experienced using test gear. It gives you a clear status on the battery health ranging from \"green\" (good battery that can hold a charge) to \"red\" (battery can't hold a charge and should be replaced). You can also go further and run tests on voltage, charge system and starting system conditions. The only faults I found with the device is that the screen is very hard to read in the sun (best used indoors in a garage) and the manual is not very helpful for learning how (and why) to use the tester. That aside, it's a very handy device to have to assess 12v battery health without having to take it to a parts store for diagnostics.",
				33: "I've been using Bosch wipers for many years, and have been especially pleased with their ICON blade. It clears the windshield very well with no streaks, and does so with far less noise than any of the OEM blades I've had on my cars. While this new blade (Clear Advantage) is also excellent when it comes to clearing the windshield without any streaking, and it was very easy to install on my Infiniti EX. However, it makes more noise than the ICON. Rather than a hushed \"wisp-wisp\" sound, I get a small amount of chatter at the peak of the stroke. Not enough to be irritating, but certainly more than the ICON. I'll continue to use these, but will be replacing them with some ICONs when their useful life is over or if the chattering gets louder. While the ICONs are a bit more expensive, I think they are a better blade.",
				34: "I've been using paste wax for the past 30+ years and I appreciate how it provides a beautiful finish.  This is the first time I've used a \"black wax\" and it does do a nice job. I used Meguiar's Black Wax on my 1996 black Honda Civic.  The hood is quite scratched up by now so I thought this might be a good test to see what effect it had on a scratched up surface.  I wish I could attach the photos I took.  I put Meguiar's on the right (driver's side) and Turtle Wax on the left (passenger side).  Both look great, but I'd give the Meguiar's black wax just a shade more credit for a slightly nicer, darker mirror finish. I really like the tube, it is easier than dipping the applicator into a tin.  I also really like that it doesn't leave behind \"white dust\". This is a very nice product!

				35: "POWERFULI have a full sized 4wd pickup truck 5.7 L V8 engine.  When the battery went dead over at my parents house their jumper cables from their car wouldn't give enough juice to start my truck.  My dad put his charger on my battery overnight but still the truck wouldn't start. All the technical diagnostic advice I got from everyone was wonderful but I know what a dead battery is and I was sure that was the problem. Since I left my JNC jump box in my other vehicle I came back the next day and said let's give it a try with my &#34;jump box&#34;.  Needless to say it fired right up. The battery was truly dead and would not take a charge whatsoever. Jumper cables from another &#34;smaller&#34; vehicle would not supply enough cranking amps to start my truck... but the JNC had power to spare. I have used it several times over the past year and a half since I made my purchase.  It has not failed me.  I have used it to start my lawn mower, my tractor, my neighbors car, and even some stranger in the parking lot.",
				36: "This is a very good torque wrench. It's perfect to get the lug nuts on your car up to proper levels as described in your car's manual (in my case 94 foot pounds). However, for things like an oil drain plug the wrench is too unweildy to get up in there. Even with the extensions. It may just be my particular vehicle's clearance. Great torque wrench. I just wish it was a big smaller. And I understand it's large because when you get up high in foot pounds you need the extra leverage. Just a nitpicky thing of mine. I really wish it were smaller to get into those tight places. If it could start small and telescope for extra leverage then it would be perfect. Anyway, the wrench works perfectly. When you hit the proper poundage it makes a loud popping noise to alert you that you've reached the level you set on the wrench. Really, a great torque wrench.",
				37: "These ACDelco wiper blades ship with multiple adapters so they will fit a variety of vehicles. The installation directions cryptic and virtually useless.  I wish I'd noticed the videos provided on the product page before I did my install. The adapters are bulky in size and are noticeably distracting in your field of vision when you're driving.  Furthermore, both the adapters and the blades are made of plastic similar to what you'd expect from a Chinese made dollar store toy.  The blades feel super flimsy and do not even have the strength to hold the wiper against the curve of the windshield from end to end.  The actual rubber wiper does a decent job, where it touches the glass. These blades come equipped with a wear indicator that is supposed to let you know when it is time to replace the blade.  I do not have any expectation that the blade will actually last long enough for that indicator to be needed. *This review applies to both of the two different lengths of blades I tested*",
				38: "***UPDATED 09/03/2013***I just bought a bed rail kit for my truck and needed to remove these from the stake holes to install the rails.  1 cracked the plastic immediately as I pressed down on the screws.  Of the 8 screws I attempted to remove, 7 stripped the heads and 1 actually had backed itself out before I even got to it.  I ended up cracking the plastic off of them in order to get them out.  The aluminum block that locks the tie downs in place had corroded and locked the screws in the block.  I liked them when they were in there but this just ruined it for me.  There's ~$50 just gone.*************************Initial impressions: Very satisfied with this product. I am using them on an '05 dodge 2500. These kind of jingle a little when driving etc but I'm not annoyed by it at all.  My swingcase tool box makes far more noise.  They seem durable and well made.  Under loads they will shift in the stake holes so they're not lined up properly.  No biggie, just move them back.",
				39: "On the plus side, this comes in nice packaging (doesn't include the sprayer) and smells nice. Unfortunately, it is carnauba-based and doesn't last at all. Think maybe one or two car washes or a month max. Of course, there are some paste/liquid carnauba waxes that only last a month, but there are some that will last several months. My point is that there are better polymer-based spray-on or quick-detailer products out there. This cannot take the place of a proper wax, but it is convenient in that you can spray it on while drying your car and add a little bit of protection until you can use a proper wax. As far as spray on products, there are better products out there if time is what you're trying to save. These include a range of products from Ultima Paint Guard Plus (a wipe-on walk-away paint sealant) to Finish Kare #425 (a spray-on/quick-detailer). In the end, it is OK, but then I knock off a star because it has a pretty bad tendency to streak which takes extra effort and towels to buff off.",
				40: "I purchased this and 1 other cargo net at the same time because I was a little worried of the potential that one of them might be cheap and untrustworthy. I was about to ride 1600 miles on my motorcycle and didn't want to worry about my net breaking. Thank god, because this one is terrible. You'll notice that there are 2 different nets pictured on this product's page; one with thick plastic-looking hooks, and another picture with very thin metal-looking hooks. The net that arrived was the very thin one. The package read \"Bicycle Cargo Net.\" Not what I would consider heavy duty enough to use on my motorcycle... For $2 more you can find cargo nets on Amazon that actually ARE heavy duty. I find myself wondering if the positive reviewers actually received the net with the thicker hooks? My recommendation... spend the extra couple dollars and get the better net. Here's one: B003M694T2",
				41: "I have owned these for about 8 years now.  They have held up very well.  No bend or flex ever noticed.  I use them for any under-car work that doesn't require the wheels being removed.  They are light, and easy to store by hanging them off a screw using the hole they already have built in. To the reviews that say they slide a lot: you need to have a gentle foot on the gas pedal.  If you try to drive up the ramps fast, you may push the ramp.  Take your time, be smooth with the gas, and you'll get up ok. Note if you own a low-riding sports car, the angle of these might not be low enough for you.  The easy solution to that problem is to take something like a 1\"x10\" board and butt it against the ramp.  Drive up on the wood first then continue onto the ramp. For the price, these are an A+ purchase!",
				42: "A good Made in USA chock.  It may cost about a buck less each at Walmart, if you can find it. There is a hole in the side for a rope to hold one or two together for each side of the tire.  Don't buy the one with a rope. It costs twice as much for the same one chock, NOT two. The heavy rubber Buyers Rubber Wheel Chock - 5in.W, Model# WC1467A at $8.99 each at Northern Tools are heavier and provides a better grip on concrete, but they are heavy to carry around.  I use the Buyers' ones in the garage and carry the Camco ones in my trunk. Also NOTE that the Buyer's ones are made in the same place as the expensive Race Ramps Branded ones costing 50% more. The Buyers ones are nearly identical, are exactly the same size and weight.  The Race Ramps ones have shallow slits cut into the bottom.",
				43: "The raditor hose on my wife's car broke off on her drive home.  She barely made it home.  I replaced the hose and the coolants the next day and the car has been running fine.  However, the check-engine light was still on.  I suspected it maybe related to the lost of coolants, but I wasn't completely sure.  After she drove around for the next several days, the light still didn't go off, so I decided to buy a odb scanner. This unit was the cheapest one on amazone and it has nearly all 5 stars from most reviewers.  I plugged in the unit, and it gave me the code p0217 which engine temp high.  The unit has an erase function, I selected erase, and the check-engine light went off.  The whole process took me less than 2 min. This is a simply an very effective and afforable product.",
				44: "If your interior is already cleaned, don't use it.  It will leave lots of lint on your dash.  I have a one week new car and i wanted to keep my interior dust free.  So I got this from Amazon with other car care products.  I had applied some ArmorAll on my dash and leather seats to keep it protected.  After a few days I am noticing some dusts are beginning to collect on my dash.  So I wanted to start using this duster.  After opening it brand new out of the blister pack, I used it on my dash and it left a trail of lint on my dash and door panel.  I thought the duster is chemically treated so that it should \"Pick UP\" dust instead of leaving \"LINT\"?  Now I am not sure if I would ever use this again....",
				45: "I bought this in May of 2013 and it's now September 1, 2013. I tried to use this cord for the first time over the Labor Day weekend holiday with no results. Michigan summers feels many times like your in Kentucky with the heat & humidity. With that said, I needed something to cool me down camping along the West Michigan shorelines. The Endless Breeze did a great job of that but I needed an extension cord to run it. I finally opened this extension cord up and tried to use it. NOTHING! I thought that maybe I needed to check the fuse? So I did and guess what. It didn't even have the capability of using a fuse. That's dangerous and could blow an electronic device up...I notified Amazon and as usual, they gave me an opportunity to send it back even though I'm out of the return date. Thanks Amazon, your the best.",
				46: "Most products I've tried have left the nasty white streaks on my windshield when I turn on my wipers.  Not this stuff.  I actually added it to RainX Bug Wash the first time.  Then I added it to plain water when I ran the bug wash out.  Both times it left my windshield perfectly waterproof.  Best time to use it is when it's dry.  If you use it when it's raining it'll bounce off the water instead of going into the windshield.  I just spray a splash or two every time I start my car that way it's always ready in case it rains.  And when the thunderstorms come and people are pulling off the side of the road because their wipers can't keep up, you won't barely even need wipers since the rain beads up and runs off.  Perfect product!",
				47: "Toyota does not make a locking gas cap for the Tacoma and the gas hatch door is not a locking type.  If you want to lock the gas tank this is one of few options to do so.  As you can see by it's picture, the cap is threaded to the bottom which is NOT the same as Toyota's OEM cap, which is smooth for about a half inch to make replacing the cap after filling the tank easier. I had to call Stant to make sure this would fit on my 2012 as the Amazon guide indicated it would not. I does fit but is not as slick as the original. Some online reviews and the Toyota manual warn about a \"check engine\" light if the gas tank is not properly sealed by the cap. That was not an issue with mine. I'd spend more money and buy one that fit better if it was available but from my research I couldn't find one.",
				48: "I purchased this to charge and Maintain batteries but the unit I got does not maintain at all and the cooling fan never operates no matter what amp charge setting. Connected to a car battery I start charging and it shows battery is at 70% which is nice and after full charge at 100% the charger goes into Charge/Maintain mode but that's where it stops working like others have reported...came back to the battery after two days and the battery isn't charged and so I unplug the charger and plug it back in and it shows battery at 52%. The battery is connected to 4 10 watt LED lights that come on after dark for 6 hours so I expected this charger to start charging when the battery is down but that is not the case like how my last battery charger/maintainer worked. It only seems to charge and not maintain so It's being returned to Amazon. Don't trust it to keep a battery maintain. Update. Amazon replace charger and was quick about it...but the new charger arrived DOA and now on the way back to Amazon for refund. Done with this brand.",
				49: "I purchased the Yamaha because of the good reviews and I'm a Yamaha fan owning a few products like my ATV. I had a Honda EU2000i that was 3 years old and I sold it with a travel trailer but now I felt I should of kept it. First thing I noticed when the Yamaha arrived was it seemed louder then the Honda but I thought I was being to critical. So later we went camping at my favorite spot in the desert and after placing the yamaha 30 feet from trailer where I would put the Honda I noticed the Yamaha was louder. With The Honda I could barely hear it when im in the trailer but the Yamaha was not as quit and I could easily hear it running. I was hoping it would be the same but because it's louder Im not happy at all so I sold the Yamaha and now looking to get another Honda...but dang it... Amazon is out of stock on the Honda... so Im of to Camping world. I would not recommend this generator if you want the most quietest one...but if the sound isn't an issue then it's comparable to the Honda.",
				50: "These appear to be as well-made as other brands of plastic RV leveling blocks. Amazon's price was slightly higher than Walmart's when I bought mine. They work under the tires to compensate for uneven campsites and under my hydraulic leveling jacks to extend their range and/or prevent them from sinking into soft ground or damaging soft asphalt in summer heat. Kept clean, they won't mildew or hold dirt and moisture like blocks of wood, weigh less and they come in a handy zippered bag for neat storage. I haven't yet broken any of them. Unfortunately the splashy advertising on the box touting a 3 year comprehensive warranty is a joke. Once you unpack your purchase you discover that in order to file a warranty claim, you must ship the broken or cracked block prepaid to Irving, Texas along with a check for $5.00 for \"shipping and handling.\" Considering that Amazon's price per block is about $3.70, paying to ship a broken block plus sending a $5.00 payment means that a warranty claim costs more than twice the original purchase.",
				51: "These 'miracle-in-a-bottle' things can get reviews from all over the place, both positive and negative, so I don't want to join the extreme voices here.  My experience is based on necessity since the winter fuel here in the northwest is so lousy that all of our vehicles start rough and burn hard.  The awful performance is most obviously when you need to suddenly accelerate hard and the vehicle misfires or stutters. So I tried a couple bottles of this Lucas fuel stuff in two or our rigs and the main thing I noticed was that things are smoother, as you'd expect in normal circumstances.  Now I bought the gallon version and am refilling these smaller bottles and using it full time (pencils out to be about a buck a treatment doing it this way) and it's been about five tanks.  Definitely smoother but not noticing any savings in the miles per gallon department yet.  Perhaps on long trips where it's mostly freeway mileage?  Don't know and really don't care.  The injectors are clear and things are as they should be. Not a miracle, just maintenance...",
				52: "These sound proofing mats are extremely stiff. I wanted to use them in my vehicle's tailgate. I took the precaution of taking a hair dryer out to warm them up so they would fit securely since the flooring has some very wide grooves. Even with that these would not conform to the flooring, they lay on top.It would take several more purchases in order to cover the whole area; there are numerous other products out there that seem more reasonable in cost. With this partial coverage there is no difference in the sound level and I have no confidence that these will stay on with the constant loading and unloading of items, since they refuse to stick to the whole flooring, but just the tops of the wide  grooved surface - wish they would state that surface must be completely flat. It does show the mat bending to the curve and bumps of a door in their directions - sure didn't work for me.",
				53: "Ordered these to go along with my new Race Ramps.  I wanted to stay with a rubber product for use on the ground and especially on the Race Ramps because I didn't want to risk damage to the ramps.  Really nice and heavy, does what it claims, prevents wheels from moving accidentally. I also have a pair of metal wheel chocks that are made in the USA and while I still use those, these have become my favorite, the metal ones have shown their age with rust around the chocks. The only negative that I can post about is the cost.  Ideally, it should be much less than what Race Ramps charges for the chocks.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help.",
				54: "I found washing cars at home in Florida did not give the same results as California Bay Area water. Too much spoting and white residue left.Saw a review where some one else used this filter for improving car wash water so I bought this filter. PRO: Great looking product for the cost. Gret looking packaging. Product screw thread fit water tight to water source and hose. After a few gallons the water comes out clear and works well for washing a car and rinsing it off. CON: Water flow a first was about 60% of normal due I assume to flow restriction. Water flow after a few more minutes and less than 5 gallons was reduced to 10% of normal. The reduced flow could barely remove the car wash soap. First few gallons had a lot of black, I assume carbon, color to the water that became clean and clear water as seen in the bucket. Note: I did verify the high flow direction as the lable showed. I may try to upload photos later. Overall: For Florida hose water in the space coast area and used for car wash this is not a good product. For a motorcycle or small product okay. For other uses I have no idea. Would not buy again",
				55: "It works pretty well for light use after I cut off the cigarette lighter power plug and replaced it with a 10 GAUGE 2 PIN QUICK DISCONNECT HARNESS, into which I can plug a set of Battery Tender 081-0069-4 Alligator Clips with Black 2-Pin Quick Disconnect Plugor plug directly into a Battery Tender 081-0069-6 Ring Terminal Harness with Black Fused 2-Pin Quick Disconnect Plug attached to my motorcycle battery. It works pretty well now with a direct connection to the battery, especially if the car/motorcycle engine is running. With that modification, this little pump is fine for bicycle and motorcycle tires and for topping off a slightly low car tire, but I wouldn't want to use it to fully inflate a full-sized car or truck tire from beginning to end. The little pump gets pretty hot after a couple of minutes. The gauge on mine is fairly accurate, close enough to be considered reliable. Before I modified the power connector, it continually blew fuses, and, after putting in a stronger fuse, the connection got exceedingly hot after only a few minutes of use. My new connections don't get hot at all.",
				56: "This device does what the description says:<br>- Built in air compressor with cable to inflate tires. Also come with pins to inflate bike, sports balls and such.<br>- Jumper cables (have not tried yet but will update review when the need arises to use cables)/<br>- Also comes with USB and A/C ports for charging devices.<br>- Does not come with a extension cord to charge device, and the plug is located tightly behind unit.<br>This device is great for inflating tires and just like a good air compressor it comes with a built in psi measure to keep track on the pressure in the tires as you are inflating them. This is a very heavy item even for me being a young male. Please note that you MUST charge this device for 24 hours BEFORE using it. Failure to do so according to the manufacture instructions can damage the item. It seems to be very durable and perfect for the good Samaritan or the stranded guy or gal at the side of the road. I will give more information as I use this device. I hope this review helps and please give it a thumbs up if it helped you. Thanks.",
				57: "Once I received the SSS (Self-Stor Step) I reviewed the contents and set about installing.  The SSS comes with very little guidance and I understand why.  Too many variables with multiple step manufactures and RV models.  Also absent is any hardware.  So I went to my local hardware and purchased 4 stainless steel button head 1/4-20 by 5/8\" bolts, self locking nuts and 6 flat washers. I pre-drilled the existing mounting holes in the SSS to accommodate a 1/4 inch bolt.  I flipped my lower step up, located the SSS, c-clamped it down and drilled the SSS hinge side.  I installed the bolts and tightened them in place.  That held the SSS while I drilled the clip side holes.  I installed the remaining bolts and I was finished.  I used one flat washer at each inside nut location.  I used the remaining two under the bolt head at the clip location.  And I feel the SSS is a very nice addition which makes my RV steps stable and SAFE.  I prefer using Stainless Steel hardware as the powder coat will cause enough rust on its own someday.",
				58: "I am totally UNimpressed. I ride a motorcycle, and as most people who ride, use waterless car/cycle wash products all the time.  I have tried many, many different varieties, and most are along the lines of this product, Griot's Garage 11285 Spray-On Car Wash Kit.  They leave much to be desired, leave bugs and road grime, and leaves a less-than shiny end result. That said, the towels are GREAT. The price is 29.99 for one bottle and three towels.  This is FAR overpriced. My recommendation--get the EZ Detailer!  It's awesome!  It applies evenly, cleans bugs and road grime, and leaves a SHINY bike.  You can see it here, but you can get it directly from their website by the case (that's what I do).

				59: "Having read the glowing reviews of this product by others here on Amazon, I went ahead and ordered a bottle of Zymol Z507 Leather Cleaner and got right to work on the well worn leather of my car with beige leather interior. I had excellent results. Using a white color micro-fiber towel and just a little bit of rubbing, years of ground in dirt and grime came up in mere moments. With each successive application, that white towel got dirtier and dirtier while the seat upholstery emerged fresh, clean and rejuvenated. After the third time 'round, I was done.  The leather looked like new again and was smooth, supple and not least, smelled great. Notably, it did not darken the leather, which some famous brands are known to do. It's very mild too ... no harsh chemicals. This is a great product that delivers excellent results with minimum effort. It is head and shoulders above other leather cleaners -- cleaners that require an enormous amount of \"elbow grease\" to yield lesser results. I highly recommend it.",
				60: "I purchased the Camco 11553 Anode Rod for my Atwood heater.  The anode was poorly manufactured and had a slight bend in the shaft.  This slight bend is enough to mis-align the treads in the cap section to the point where if forced into place, it would cross thread the female threads in the water heater.  It is not worth the time or hassle to return, so there it is . . .  scrap.  In the event the anode did thread in properly, the instructions indicate you should pull the anode once a month to be sure you keep the anode in a removable state.  Apparently, if you do not remove it once a month, it will corrode in position, making it extremely difficult to remove.  I have decided to keep my factory installed nylon drain plug as the plug of choice.  My previous RV was over 8 years old when I sold it and I never had corrosion problems with the nylon plug. Save your money.",
				61: "This truly is an absolutely abysmal product. The black brush broke within two minutes of very light usage. Before it broke, the bristles kept falling out, making my attempt at detailing redundant as I had to go back and individually remove these bristles, one by one, since they fell out and flew all over the place. On top of that, the bristles seem to be dyed black. I say this because the second they came in contact with a very light detergent, the color transferred to the surface I was working on and was difficult to clean off. Then the entire brush fell apart. See my uploaded photos. The vent tool is worthless. No dirt would stick to it. All it did was smear the dirt around. And then the white brush... it's too light to do anything productive with. It's like trying to detail with someone's pony tail. It's just floppy and serves no real purpose.I resorted back to using the free toothbrushes I got from a hotel and q-tips. They are better made and leave a car looking better than this product. Just total garbage.",
				62: "There are some confusing reviews for this product that made me curious enough to buy it. To clear up the confusion: this tire inflator does not readily work with Presta valves and it does not ship with an adapter, so you will have to get your own adapter. I am primarily using it for my bike tires that are rated 110 to 140psi - my compressor produces about 110 psi, maybe a bit more. Even though this inflator is only rated up to 100psi, I with the 200psi gauge this allows me to check and correct the tire pressure quickly. I tried the inflator with a car tire and noticed that the mechanism that clips it to the valve is a bit unusual (and flimsy/cheap). Air will escape unless the hose is held totally straight and there is no lateral force to the connection. This is a bit difficult to achieve. This is no different when I use it with the Presta adapter. I am not sure I would order this product again.",
				63: "This funnel is a must-have tool if you work professionally on cars.  This is the second Lisle funnel that I have purchased for my shop and it is worth every penny.  The adapters work on 90% of the vehicles we see in my shop.  We use it regularly for any cooling system repairs as it is truly spill free once you connect is using the included adapter.  Where this product really shines, and the main reason I stated it is a must-have tool for your shop, is the ability it has to act as a reservoir during the coolant bleeding process.  With the funnel securely attached to the radiator you can fill the funnel half-way, run the vehicle up to temp where thermostat opens and then the air bubbles bleed right up.  It's great for eliminating air pockets in tough to bleed systems because this creates a high point in the cooling system and the air bleeds right out.",
				64: "(2012 Accord LX with 16\" rims and stock tires) (Reasons why -1 star):<br>-My car is stock height, but these ramps come very close to scrapping the bumper (within an inch).  I don't see anyone being able to use these ramps with a low profile sports car.<br>-There was a bit of excess plastic on the bottom that I had to cut off to get one of the ramps to lay flat and not see-saw wobble.  Quality control should have caught this.<br>-There isn\'t a lot of room for error if you don\'t have your tires perfectly centered.  If you have a performance car with extra-wide tires then you\'ll probably have rubber hanging off the edges.<br>-The stop-lip at the end of the ramp could be a bit taller.  If you idle into it, it will stop your car from moving.  But if you accidentally hit the gas too hard, it won\'t do much to stop you.  If you have large diameter tires, it would be very easy to roll to far without feeling it (until your car slams into the ground and you destroy your bumper).",
				65: "Loses accuracy after riding in the saddle bag for a while. I filled up tires with a portable compressor with digital gauge, that shuts off at designated PSI. Double check with this EZ Air Gauge and had to let like 10 pounds out. I think to myself, this isn't right so double check pressure with a pen gauge from the car, and sure enough tire is 10 pounds light. Either my portable compressor and pen gauge are lying identically, or this gauge has lost it's accuracy. I will know for sure how much it's off once I get the chance to swing it by a tire shop. All of this may seem minor but on a motorcycle 10 pounds can become a huge safety concern. A gauge that is more than 3-4 pounds off will go in the trash. My safety is worth more than the 5-10 bucks I save on a bargain gauge.",
				66: "I have just ordered 2 of these SC 1200a chargers, but have been useing two identical SC 1200a chargers for the last four years. The chargers have worked well at maintaining charge on two OPTIMA yellow top batterys and also 2 trolling motor, deep cycle batterys . The chargers are in constant use and have done a great job of keeping communications gear powered in service daily and through power outages the batterys did as expected. I have ordered 2 more as 'spares', but have had no indication of problems (except for ocasional dust removal with caned air) they are trouble free. I have also used them to charge weak auto batterys from time to time and always got the expected results. Before useing these SC 1200a chargers, I was concerned about the ability of high frequency chargers vs chargers with heavy transformers. The SC 1200a's have proved to be FASTER at rechargeing my batterys and have outlasted the majority of other chargers I have used, they are also much lower cost than many I have used before.",
				67: "Doesn't do what it promises. That sums it up. This isn't a cheap piece of electronics. I purchased this for ONE reason, which was CLAIMED by Superchips. The ability to turn off the TPMS. This piece of junk doesn't do that. Does it eliminate one electronic &#34;ping&#34; - yes. Was that worth $150? Hell no. They claimed they &#34;were working on it&#34; and it would be fixed. They haven't done so. If your jeep will still throw up the tire light - it doesn't solve the TPMS issue. I don't care about eliminating a single &#34;ping&#34; to the tune of $150. This was the worst purchase I have EVER made for my JK. Because it &#34;locks&#34; to your specific JK it isn't returnable to any store. Superchips should be ashamed they put this piece of trash out to market with the marketing they did. I am sure it does some things well - but if you are ADVERTISING a function that it doesn't have that is a SERIOUS PROBLEM.",
				68: "These are ok. They keep the water from reaching the floor, but without ridges - they also keep the water to where it hits your shoes. In and out of the car in snowy and icy conditions and you can be damn sure that you are going to end up getting freezing water in your shoes as an unpleasant surprise. They are hard to empty without spilling because of the lack of a lip on the front of the liner. So, you either wait till the water drys on its own - which doesn't happen in winter, soak it up with a towel, or attempt to empty it and end up with water exactly where it wasn't supposed to go. However they probably work fine for sandy or muddy conditions, as they are pretty easy to clean off. Overall, there are better options and I wish I had gone with one of the other options instead.",
				69: "This switch works fine, and looks great in the dashpiller for a JK from rugged ridge. But the lights are BRIGHT whether the switch is on or off. In the day, there is nothing wrong with this. At night, if you have your panel full - there are 4 bright lights putting light into the cabin. If you like the cabin to be as dark as possible it is annoying. The hot issue has seemed somewhat silly as these could/should have been LED bulbs. They are incandescent, and if it is warm and the car has been on for a while I would guess the light part gets to around 130-140 degrees. Hot enough you don't want to keep your finger on it. I cannot imagine this is going to be detrimental to the long term (5-10 years) function of the switch, or at least its appearance. When you have gone to the effort to install and wire everything up - you don't want to do it again ever. Edit - solution given to me by fellow customer.",
				70: "I can't say this is the best product I have ever used for interiors. (That belongs to products I have used from Zaino Brothers). But these are adequate, and do seem to be less harsh than typical cleaners. I did have a problem with the bottles. Weirdly, every bottle in my kit had a \"straw\" for the pump that was way too long. It actually curled from the bottom of the bottle so that it was unable to pump any fluid. Not just in one or two bottles, but all of them. Not a flaw of the product itself, but a bit annoying when I was trying it out. I did not think that the cleaners worked quite as good as others I have used, especially the leather cleaner. But they did not seem very harsh at all, and using a light brush (I used a toothbrush) yielded good results. Would I use these again? Probably yes. Would I go out of my way to find them? Probably not. But they do represent a good way to keep materials clean while helping protect your interior as well as helping the environment.",
				71: "The first unit I received would not hook up with the gasket installed. It appeared very tight without the gasket, so I used it with near perfect success. Had I purchased a clear extender, I would have flushed longer, but that is in the past. The second attempt to use the product it appeared to fit a little looser, so I attempted to use the gasket. Well, all four ears broke off the pump assembly. I was able to get a replacement unit at Camping World, as I explained I had only used it once, and it was now unusable. They replaced the unit \"no questions asked\" and the new unit had its gasket more deeply seated, and hooked up fine. My R V was equipted with black and grey tank washers, but never having a clear section of hose, it is now obvious that the black tank was never throughly cleaned. After multiple flushes, the water finally ran mostly clean. I recommend you nevere dump without a clear section of hose so that you can tell when the job is done.",
				72: "All of my cheap dollar store garden hose nozzles gave up the ghost this summer. They leaked, sprayed from every angle except the desired one and one, just wouldn't shut off. Cheap Chinese-made Junk! I read the reviews of the Bon-Aire Original Ultimate and it sounded like a take off on NYC's Famous Original Ray's Pizza. However, it was cheap enough so I took a chance. When it arrived, I immediately hooked it up and so far, it's all you could want from a garden hose nozzle. You turn it on or off by turning left or right. The spray patterns go from gentle waterfall to direct stream and all stops in between. I can't tell how long it will last but it looks and feels well made. It could have had a higher rating but, darn, it's made in China. Fairly-priced Chinese-made not-junk! The decrease of rating is no reflection on China or the product; just my disappointment that we don't have a hose nozzle this good with a made in the USA sticker on it.",
				73: "The idea, while great, is not the greatest in execution because the manufacturer has chosen to only make the tape 3/8 inch wide.  When you bend this in half to fit your door edge, it really doesn't leave much to work with...less than 2/16 inch on each side.  Add to that the thickness of the door edge and there is even less.  It amazes me how companies try to save a few fractions of a penny to increase their bottom line, and leave it to the consumer to fend for themselves, in this case, to install this to look nicely, while not having much to grab onto.  I only did about 8 inches of my door edge, where my door would make first contact.  It's clear, so that's good and my tape is nearly invisible.  But good luck trying to tape this down your entire door frame without messing up because it's not wide enough.",
				74: "I had cloudy, not yellow, headlights on an RX330.  Bought the kit hoping to get good results.  Cloudiness of the lenses was partially removed to about 50% better than it was.  I followed steps closely.  At the end the plastic lens had more noticeable fine scratches than before (basically this is a fine sandpaper system). It seems the final coat is just an oil based gel that makes the plastic look wet and shiny but I doubt it will last more than a week.  Not fully happy with the result, on a whim I got out my Novus kit (1,2,3) that I bought on Amazon for plastic on my boat and around the home. I gave the lens a good Novus 3 rubbing, then 2, then the final polish coat Novus 1.  Honestly I think my results were much better than with the rain X kit.  Less scratching and seemed more effective.  I think the Novus 1,2,3 kit cost around $12 but I cannot remember as it was a few years ago.",
				75: "So after reading the great reviews here I bought this item at Wal-Mart and took it home to charge my deep cycle marine batteries. Worked fine for about an hour, then I noticed that it seemed to be stalled at 85% charge.  I did some more internet reading and discovered that this is a common problem with this unit, the readout stalls at a given percentage and never changes unless you unhook it and rehook it to the battery.  I did that and instantly the readout changed to 100%. So now I know for a fact I can never trust my brand new charger to tell me when it's done charging. And worse, despite being 100% charged the unit never switched over to trickle charge.  So despite being billed as a \"smart\" charger it's just a normal full power charger that will boil your battery dry if you leave it hooked up too long.  Why spend $45 on something that a $10 charger will do? Not only is it junk, the packaging is a complete lie as well.  Now I know and you can bet your sweet cajones I'll never buy a Schumacher anything again.",
				76: "I have a Power Bright PW1100-12 which works well and the Power Bright specifications state these are very efficient units (>90% max.) which is why I also tried this smaller unit for another need. This inverter is heavily built and on the outside seems like a quality unit.  When first powered up using the accessory outlet adapter, the unit ran my 75 watt current draw okay.  I then switched to a set of HD cables I use for the larger inverter (which probably had nothing to do with this issue) for another test with the same load and a few seconds later smoke and flames billowed out of the back for several seconds.  The green AC power LED in the front was still on and it may have been producing AC power, but I was busy shutting down the test and did not verify. For the money, this seemed like a great unit and it probably is.  Defects happen even to the best of items, but I replaced it with a 150 watt Tripplight which will travel better for its intended usage.",
				77: "I used Mothers California Gold Clay Bar to clean my car's paint before using DA polisher.  I washed my car two times and then used Mother's clay bar.  Even after two washes, when I ran my hand on the paint to feel the surface before and after claying I could feel the difference.  After claying the paint was appreciably smoother. The application was very easy - just spray the included solution and slide the bar on the paint, knead the clay when it smudges appear.  The box warns that if the bar is dropped it has to be discarded, so I was mindful of not dropping it and I did not.  It was quite easy to hold and use. The only thing I did not like about this product is that the solution smelled like cinnamon.  I am not a fan of cinnamon and that smell is unpleasant to me. Overall, this is a great product.",
				78: "I bought this tire gauge a a little over two months ago. The first few times I used it, it performed admirably. It's ergonomic, with a clear LCD display that gave a fast, precise reading.Fast forward to the end of June. After only three uses (and being stored in my glove compartment otherwise), the gauge is now wildly off. After reading the tires on my truck as 32 PSI four weeks ago, plugging it in today registered 41.5 PSI. I thought maybe it was the heat we've had this past week, but a change of 9.5 PSI seemed a little high, so I tested it with two other tire gauges, which read 33 and 33.5 PSI, respectively. I used a pump with a manual gauge to drain a tire and inflate it to 33 PSI, but when I tested the tire with this gauge it read it first as 41.5 PSI and ten seconds later as 40 PSI. Perhaps I got a dud, but any gauge that's off by that much so soon raises a red flag for me. I'll be looking for my next tire gauge elsewhere.",
				79: "This is very lightweight, the carrying bag is thin but sturdy enough, and it has a pocket inside to keep the directions if you fold them!  I wish the accessories were in a separate container or secured inside.  I put mine into a small zipper bag to keep them together.  When you put the inflator back into the bag it only fits one direction, because of the LED light. I agree that the light could have used a focusing lens but I do like the way it swivels to give you more options on positioning.  The instructions say the gauge is just a guide and not to believe it's the correct pressure.  I found the gauge to be about 4 lbs. lower than actual, so you do need an independent tire gauge to check to see if there was enough pressure.  I do like the way you can set the pressure you desire and it will turn off when it reaches it, a nice safety feature. It was easy to put on, the buttons are self-explanatory.  A good value, I think.",
				80: "This is a very good LED Light Bar that works very well. I installed it on my 2007 Dodge Ram 1500, just above my bumper so it isn't very visible in day light until it come on. The lights are bright even in the day, and very bright at night, adding more safety to my truck. My only complaint is with the instruction sheet, which indicates to install the light with the wires on the right side as in the picture. I installed it like indicated and plugged it into my trailer wiring plug. When I tested the lights the turn signal activated the wrong side, so I had to remove the light bar and reinstall it in the opposite direction. The good thing was I had installed it using the included brackets instead of the double sided tape. I highly recommend you plug it in to test it BEFORE you install it to your vehicle, especially if you plan to use the double sided tape. Other than the poor instruction sheet, this would have a higher rating. I also like the lifetime warranty on this item.",
				81: "We own an Air-O-Swiss AOS 7135 ultrasonic humidifier.  For a few weeks now, the machine has indicated, through its warning light, that it required cleaning.  Our Air-O-Swiss 7135 is hyper-sensitive; its warning light goes on with the tiniest (invisible) speck.  So, initially we bought Air-O-Swiss EZ Cal Cleaner / Descaler.  Didn&#8217;t do the trick!  Thereafter we replaced the Demineralization Cartridge (and contents.)  Still no change.  Even after following the instructions to the letter and cleaning with specialized brushes, our humidifier wouldn&#8217;t extinguish its cleaning light.  So, last resort, this EZCal Pro. Again, applied the product as instructed; without success.  So, our humidifier is presently running with the irritating little light on, but operating as it should be nevertheless.  The EZ Cal Cleaner / Descaler and the EZCal Pro liquid didn&#8217;t do wonders in our case either.  So, can't say that we're thrilled with the Air-O-Swiss maintenance products.  In the future we'll stick to vinegar or some other generic decalcification agent.",
				82: "Works on my 2001 Honda Civic. Does not work with 2010 Honda CRV.  Link error.  It's so incompatible that when the scanner start to scan, that the Slip Warning light would come on.  (freaked me out, but after I turn the ignition key off and back on, the light would go away). I might keep it around just for the civic and as a loaner. I know this thing is cheap, but if I was to do it all over, I would save the money and buy a better unit. I wish there would be a spreadsheet where people can enter type of cars would work or wouldn't work on this unit.<br>====update 08/13/13<br>Well, I finally called the tech support and see if anything could be done to the \"Link Error\" issue that I'm having with my CRV (tricks or updates). Apparently, this model MS300 has been discontinued since 2007.  The support person can't even find the support document on his side. Since the support person was a nice guy, I didn't want to give him too much hard time, so I asked his opinion on a better model from Autel.",
				83: "This device attaches securely to the tow vehicle, but at a cost. They are cumbersome to attach and detach, with several moving parts and the potential to scratch the tow vehicle paint during either process if you don't have three hands available. To attain the secure vibration free fit, you must crank down on the ratcheted web strap hard enough to deform the door where it attaches to the window channel. It also deforms the rubber window seal. Foam pads protect the door somewhat where the bracket would otherwise rub on the body, but if the area isn't meticulously clean beforehand I can see where it would dull the paint over time. Because of the metal claw part that fits into the window channel, raising and lowering the window caused a screeching sound on my driver's side window. Finally, when they are detached from the door, they make for a very bulky awkward device that doesn't store conveniently or compactly in the vehicle. I'm sending them back.",
				84: "Bought this to air up my tires on my Jeep XJ when offroading.  I have used the unit several times and it has worked as advertised.  Great unit for the price.  I read where some have complained of the small clips for the battery and I do agree with them.  If you don't have a &#34;military post&#34; battery terminal, it may be difficult for you to attach to the battery terminal.  Since I have that kind of terminal, connection is easy.  Your milage may vary there, depending. The unit is quieter than I had expected it to be and is a workhorse.  I have used it on other tires (lawn mower, motorcycle, etc.) and it fills them up quickly.  The time for my 31&#34; tires is quicker than I expected as well.  No regrets on purchasing the item.  This particular model did not come with a bag, but it is small and will fit in any small zipper bag.",
				85: "While these mitts are meant to be used for a traditional wet car wash, I have found that they work nicely in between washes to clean of the dust and keep the car looking nice. When you live in a dusty area like we do, it's often nice to be able to wipe down a vehicle between washes. When you're in a drought, washing cars is frowned on, so wiping down the car on a regular basis allows for a cleaner car without the use of water. I like that these mitts fit both my small hand as well as my husband's large hand. (He normally wears at least a XXL glove.) The cuff keeps the mitt on my hand even though it's a bit loose, and it's not too constricting for my husband. The little microfiber &#34;fingers&#34; grab a good bit of dust and dirt from the vehicle. Overall, we're pleased with these mitts and look forward to seeing how they hold up with use.", 
				86: "Good gauge. Easy to read, easy to use and seems to be accurate.  Particularly like that you can have the pressure reading in between the air source and your tire.  I pumped a tire up to 65psi and the gauge worked flawlessly.  I gave it for stars because I was expecting it to be a little heavier/hardier.  Out of the package I was surprised how &#34;cheap it felt -- the rubber around the gauge is thin and comes off easily (but is also easy to put back on). I guess I was expecting thicker and heavier all around.  BUT, although it feels a little cheaper, the big picture is it works very well.  I've had no issue(s) with it and realized that my initial out of the box concerns are trivial in comparison.  If you own a professional garage, you might want to get something beefier.  If you will use this in you home garage or vehicle., it is definitely worth the money.",
				87: "This seems to me to be a good product.  It promises to be earth friendly, which is good and safer than some petroleum based cleaners that are kind of dangerous.  We have used it in the kitchen to clean various counter and cabinet stains such as newsprint smudge, tea and coffee marks and various other unknown cleanup opportunities.  It has done a very nice job on these and a better job than most of the other cleaners we've tried.  I did test it on three different driveway stains and found it to be only partially effective.  On one, a stain from a planter base on concrete, it didn't do much to remove or lighten it.  On two driveway oil and grease stains it lightened them, but did not lighten them enough to really defeat them.  So, I'd say mixed results, but good enough results in some applications to make it a product worth buying.  Just don't expect it to do every job you may have.",
				88: "used it on a surface on my BMW 328ic near the trunk area. I had 2 little spots approx. 1x2&#34; on the left and right that had rust forming UNDER the rubber gasket... I brushed of the rust with a dremel type tool and metal wheel brush to clear all rust and paint and used this on top. let dry for a day before repainting and applying clear coat. It does not seem to penetrate the little rust remaining as other products. I used &#34;Rost-Egal&#34; from Germany many many years I lived there and that has been the best product so far. You use it once and just know it works. With this very liquid product I am not so sure... It did not even seem to &#34;stick&#34; very well to vertical surfaces. For the next job I will look for a &#34;thicker&#34; product that will cling more to the treated area.",
				89: "while amazon normally has a very updated and accurate fitment chart, the one for this item was off. the item was as described, and the picture was accurate of what the item looked like, however fitment showed it would fit my 02 Tahoe with the 5.3 L engine. this is not true for one reason.  - Flex Fuel - if you have a Flex Fuel 5.3 engine the filter is VERY different. you not only need a special tool to release the different type of 'quick disconnect' but you also have to get a different filter. Make sure you do your research prior to ordering from the more accurate fitment charts from the actual brand's website. If you don't have flex fuel on your engine, this should be the right one, and its just a matter of purging the fuel system, and breaking free 2 flare nuts on either side. the change only takes about 10 minutes. make sure you know what you need before ordering.",
				90: "This is a nice looking wiper blade, if you are the kind of person who notices things like that. It is all a matte black, one piece unit, without the 'traditional' metal looking flanges. It has a 'performance' look to it. I like that the blade comes with three different attachment clips, so you can pick and chose the right one for your car. That is a thoughtful touch - normally I have to futz too much with getting a wiper to fit, clipping things to 'make' them fit. They work well in the rain, clearing off a nice section to see out of, as all wipers do when they are new. They work smoothly and evenly over the glass. They don't work as well for dust, but that's really not what these are made for. Although these are touted as being superior for cold weather, the real test for me will be this summer, in the Arizona desert temperatures. Usually any wipers I install around spring end up warped by the heat a few months later. And the dust doesn't help, either. :) Recommended for wet rainy days, for ease of attachment, and for a stylish look.",
				91: "This product is so inferior to Griots that it is not funny. Look, Meguiar's makes great car wax products, this is probably a product they sub out and then add a make up too. It's too thin, to small, just all together beneath the reputation of Meguiar's product line. As a drying cloth not very good at all. As a wax removal cloth just not good enough. Listen if you detail your engine compartment these are just fine. If you are not a car person, these are going to be good enough for you, really. But if you are fussy about your car, wax it , detail it.... these would be the product you want to use for wheels, engines and door jams. I already own them so that is what I will use them for, same a an old house towel would be used. If that is what you are looking for , look no further, these will do. But for drying or wax removal....NOT.",
				92: "These were very good towels, great for waxing and polishing the car. I thought they were a little too nice to use with on nasty household/garage jobs, but great for jobs where you need a soft clean cloth to work with. Between these and the ZwipesZwipes Microfiber Cleaning Cloths (36-Pack) I thought the Z-Wipes were softer and had more depth.  That was better for car work (Polishing, Waxing), but the Heininger GarageMates did much better for polishing metal, cleaning glass, and interior work like plastics and leather. There's virtually no fuzz on these, which makes them great for things like glass and mirrors which I've had a heck of a time doing with anything but newspaper.  Use them with Rain-X 800002243 Glass Treatmentand expend much less energy and still don't get those hazy streaks. They clean up in the wash better than the zwipes, probably in part since they're dark colored and don't show the dirt as bad. Definitely a heck of a value.",
				93: "I have a reasonable amount of experience doing car detailing, and I can say this brush really is not suitable for carpets.  I was surprised, as this brush has many positive reviews -- these people have to be tearing up their carpets and upholstery with this thing. The bristles are stiff, stiffer than most tire brushes.  I sure as heck wouldn't use this thing on the carpets in my car, it would destroy them.  I would be even less inclined to use this on my upholstery, it would tear right through it.  For under six dollars, I'm sure I will find some use for it, perhaps brushing out the wheel wells -- that is about how thick and stiff the bristles are.  I suppose if you had rubber car mats it would work well for those, but those usually don't need much in the way of brushing to get clean. All in all, save your six dollars and go to the hardware store and get a brush with bristles that aren't as stiff.  You should be letting your carpet cleaner do most of the work, not your bristles.",
				94: "I purchased two sets of these for use in winterizing my RV.  Since I live in New England, I was a little skeptical on whether I truly needed them since I didn't have to worry about deterioration due to sun exposure, but I did want to protect my investment and the price was right to give them a try.  I use X-Chocks between the tires and wanted to make sure I had a little extra give in the cover allow them to stretch over it, so I purchased the 27-29&#34; size for my tires that measured approximately 26&#34;.  They fit great, reaching down to but not quite touching the ground.  The straps with snaps are fairly easy to wrap around the tire and cinch tight.  They vinyl looks good, but I may want to consider conditioning it after year to make sure it doesn't dry out and crack.  And the beige color of the vinyl matches the beige of our RV cover as well.  I will try to update this review after the first winter of us is over.",
				95: "In the reviews of this sheepskin pad I found two differing opinions, one excellent, one not.  I needed two pads and decided to chance it and so ordered.  (Item #8000CAINT8, #019912525297)  When they arrived one was simply outstanding, the other could not have been much worse.  The sheepskin or whatever it was, was thin and ragged; it looked like my dog had been chewing it.  The other was thick and fluffy and fit perfectly. I also ordered one fabric Ergo Seat Belt Shoulder Pad as a backup.  (Item #8001SL9LYG, #019912535920  )  This pad is a bit smaller but works really well, I am very pleased with it and will use it on another vehicle. None of the three pads had any noticeable odor and all fit well. I am sorry for those ordering to have to face this quality situation.  The good sheepskin pad is perfect but both sheepskin pads have the same number(#019912525297).  If you really need a pad, as I did for neck injury, I recommend trying the sheepskin - you might get lucky.  The fabric pad is extremely nice as well.",
				96: "I have already been testing a similar device,Automatic Link Smart Driving Assistantbut there were some things I didn't care for with that device so when Vine offered me the Zubie, I was definitely interested to try it out. However, at a very expensive $99/year subscription price, it's pretty hard for me to recommend this over the Automatic, which does not come with a similar requirement for use. Other reviewers have talked about the privacy concerns, and it seems that this device really would only be worth considering if you are a parent wishing to track the driving habits of your teenage driver. While this device does have some clear benefits over others, such as tracking your activity even when you don't have the app running, the cost of enrollment is just WAY too much for what I get with it when there are other similar devices that don't come with the same requirement.",
				97: "This is the second type of LED light I have tested.  I ordered 2 of these lights.  I measured the Voltage  and current at each light.  Each light came from different suppliers. LED Light 112.612V @1.711A = 21.579 Watts, LED Light 212.581V @1.723A = 21.677 Watts. These lights are bright but the DC-DC converter is probably running too low. These might be B stock. While I wrote this review I left LED light 2 on to see what would happen when they got warm. LED Light 212.638V @1.638A = 20.701 Watts. I was going to submit my rating but I received a refurbished unit.  I sent it back because the lense was cracked and had a poor repair job.  The lenses have to be super cheap I dont know why they bother repairing them. EDIT:  Careful with the lense cover.  I cleaned mine and now it has a white haze to it.",
				98: "First thing I tested was how bright it was next to a \"55 Watt regular halogen headlight\".  This LED was not even close.  Im guessing It might be half as bright. Problem:  I measured the Voltage and current at three voltage levels.  First 12.05V @1.34A that comes out to 16.147 Watts.  Next 12.92V @ 1.24A is 16.021 Watts.  Finally 22.6V 0.72A is 16.272 Watts.  The Voltages and Currents were measured at the same time for accuracy.  The built in DC-DC converter is probably about 90% efficient.  At 90% the LEDs are only getting about 14.645 Watts.  When I compared each LED in the bar by shining it 3 inches from several surfaces, the 2 on the left are dimmer than the others.  The far left LED is the dimmest. Some companies will run there LED's a little lower Voltage to prevent burnout and increase life but this means they are not as bright as they should be. Also the light was mostly white but had yellow areas in the spot.  The lense was scratched and there was glue on the lense and housing.  Mine may have been a refurbished model.",
				99: "Pros: battery driven; flashing or steady light; flameless flare; can be used as a map light; reusable. Could be used effectively as a light that does not seriously degrade night vision. Cons: Product claims to be visible at 1000 ft, but this is only possible within a few degrees of view. One half of the top lights up for a dim presentation, but the bright LED shines out through a narrow beam like a small red flashlight. Consequently, the flare would probably not be useful in a traffic situation since it would have to be precisely aligned with oncoming traffic and would only be visible by the few drivers within this narrow beam of light. It is certainly not a good substitute for a real flare which is much brighter and omnidirectional. This little light is not as good as the emergency flashers built into vehicles. If you want a safety flare to carry in your vehicle, buy the real thing. If you want a light you can use as a map light without distracting a driver, or to see where you're walking without seriously degrading your night vision, this red light will do that well.",

				101: "The stock horn on my Evo sounded rather lame. Wired these in, in parallel, and they're not only significantly louder, but much better sounding! Not really a dull standard/stock honk noise that might be ignored. These are more likely to get the attention of any of the typical bad drivers that like to merge into you or do something else stupid/endangering. You can try to youtube these to hear the sound, but it won't do it justice. You cannot really tell how loud they sound at all from that, although you'll be able to make out somewhat how the \"distinct\" noise is, with the dual tones. And no, this is not obnoxiously sounding, or \"too loud\". You don't have to worry about being rude or annoying when you use these out in public (unless you're trying to be rude and annoying). Definitely recommend this product for someone looking to upgrade the wimpy sounding stock horns found in a lot of cars.",
				102: "Well-built metal, plastic frame with glass over LEDs, 15 feet of wire to run between light and solar panel. Rubber coverings over switched for waterproofing. Has an on/off switch with light sensing dial for how dark you want it to be before lights will even turn on. Or can even use in daylight. A timer adjuster for how long you want the lights to stay on and a sensitivity dial for motion detection. It also has a replaceable battery pack, (this is an improvement over an old one I had, not sure if it was same company though similar in looks and function) Comes with a one-year warranty. It allows the sensor to be moved for motion detection separate from the light. We installed inside a large shed that has no power, the cord to solar panel leading out under trim and drip edge to roof. Now when we go into for tools, shovels etc it lights up the whole thing and turns off after we leave. Maybe not the way everyone would use it but it works great for us. We like it. See how long the battery lasts and will update down the road.",
				103: "I've been using Meguires products for years and have been very satisfied with many of their products, but not this one.  I've tried many different types of glass cleaners from the age old Windex, to spray foam cleaners, paste cleaners, and finally this one.  This one is horrible.  While initially the cleaner seems to work, it leaves behind a thin oily residue on the glass.  In more than 30 years of detailing and taking care of cars I've never encountered a product that hazes/fogs faster than or more than this one does. To make sure I tested the product on all kinds of glass from auto glass to windows in the home, mirrors, aquariums, etc. and even tried using different drying tools from several types of paper towels, microfiber towels, synthetic chamois, and the results were always the same...it fogged/hazed on all the types of glass in a very short time.Do not waste your money on this cleaner.  I've found the very best results come from just plain distilled or R.O. water and a high quality microfiber towel.  It doesn't fog, won't harm interior window tintings, and costs practically $0.",
				104: "This is a nice product that is larger than I thought it would be yet it fits nicely in my trunk against one of the sides. It collapses nearly flat for storage when you aren't using it and yet it is quite sturdy when set up correctly. It's way more attractive and durable than a cardboard box.It can be a bit tricky to set up at first; the trick is the side metal supports need to slip UNDER the bottom surface. Pressing the arrow labels on the bottom surface helps with this. If you read the instructions, it will tell you this. Once you do this, the organizer is all setup and very rigid. I do not miss the lack of a top handle on this since it's mainly designed to remain in your trunk all the time.The bottom line is this is a useful, utilitarian and attractive item that I recommend to anyone who typically has a lot of loose items floating around in their trunk. Get organized!",
				105: "I'm not sure if it is a factory defect or it is supposed to be like that. When I shook the filter with my hand, I could hear a wobbling noise from the inside. The inside of the filter, I could move it back and ford with my finger. I have used Wix, Mobil 1, Porulator, KN and none of them I could move a thing inside the filter. Can anyone confirm it is normal before I put it on my car (this is my first RP filter)? I will just toss it away and forget about it if it is a defect (never again RP filter $12) Thanks.<br><br>Update: I talked to RP customer support and this is his reply. If you have a similar problem, do NOT put this filter on your car :) have a good day<br><br>Good Morning,<br>This doesn't sound right.  Please reply with the filter part number and your location.  We would like to get this filter back for inspection and would happily replace it for you. Thanks for choosing Royal Purple and have a great day! <br>Best Regards, <br>Christopher Barker<br>Technical Services",
				106: "YES!  This is a HUGE improvement over the gas station $1.99 pocket tire pressure gauges, will never go back!<br>PRO: <br>1. Works awesome with either tip.<br>2. Accurate for shade tree mechanics and DIY guys and gals.<br>3. Built very well, will last a very long time.<br>4. Glow in the dark feature is a funny novelty.<br>CON:<br>1. I had NO CLUE this had no memory feature. Fool me once...shame on me....<br>2. I'm still upset that the liquid filled gauges are two and sometimes three times the price.<br>3. I should have bought the 52002 model for memory, but meh it's just a gauge.<br>OTHER:<br>If you want the memory feature, get the Longacre 52002, otherwise, remember what your pressure reading was when you take, because it'll be gone when you release from the valve stem.  So in other words if you suffer from really really really really short term memory loss, don't buy this.  Then again, if you have memory loss, please don't even get near a car, bike, or anything that needs this gauge, please don't drive a car period, that's downright scary! Peace!",
				107: "I really got tired of my grease gun getting everything it came in contact with all greasy, so I happened upon this grease gun holder and just had to have it. I installed it to the side edge of my steel work table with a couple self-tapping screws. I really like this holder because it holds my grease gun firmly in place, its really easy to release it when needed and it allows me to keep the grease that may leak from the tip from getting all over everything and making a mess. When I want to use it, I just simply pull the clip handle and it pops off. To return it to its cradle, I just set the grease gun in the grove and hook the clip and pull the handle. It fits tights, yet its really easy to load and unload. If I need just a quick glob of grease, I can operate the trigger handle without removing the gun from the cradle.",
				108: "I've used Rain-X products on and off for years.  While Rain-X does shed water from the windshield as advertised, be advised that it leaves a hazy film on the windshield that produces a glare when illuminated by overhead street lights and on-coming traffic lights, which dangerously impairs vision and the ability to see the road ahead of you.  This is true during daytime driving, but is more so while driving at night, especially as you pass underneath amber-colored street lights.  Once applied, Rain-X is difficult to remove and takes quite a while to wear off by itself.  After a recent windshield replacement, to which I applied Rain-X, I realized just how badly my vision was imparied by using this product.  Glass cleaner didn't seem to work, so to remove the Rain-X, I resorted to a super-concentrated windshield cleaner.  It took several attempts, and a lot of elbow grease, but I eventually was able to remove the product from my windshield.  I tossed the remaining Rain-X products in the trash so my kids won't be tempted to use it on their car windshields.",
				109: "This cup inverter it&#8217;s a great idea, and it can also be used at home matched with a sealed acid battery, it comes with the alligator clamps for it. There are two things to keep in mind though, if being used on a car or inside the house, the inverter has little ventilation slits around its case, if one places it on a cup for a long time it will get hot, this will shorten its lifespan because circuits don&#8217;t like heat and it can even be dangerous. So, I recommend getting one of those cup holders that only are made of a plastic ring that held the cup by the top part. In this way the inverter would still have air for ventilation. If an open cup holder it&#8217;s not available, then the best is to give the inverter time to cool off after each gadget recharging.It comes with an AC outlet and four USB ports, but one must remember that it has a limit of 120 Watts, so it will only be able to charge up to that wattage regardless of the amount of devices plug into it.",
				110: "Attracted to their low price, I tried substituting these LED bulbs for the filament bulbs in a couple of my motorhome's overhead fixtures hoping I'd eventually be able to replace all of my incandescent bulbs to save power.  To make the electrical connection, I had to pry the wires from the base slightly.  Once I did that, and ensured that the polarity was correct, all of the LEDs in the bulbs came on.  But even with all of them working the light output was nowhere near as much as I was getting from my filament bulbs.  Though these are advertised as being \"white\" the color of the light was a cool light blue, casting a not-at-all warm light.  The difference in light color and light intensity between these LED bulbs and my regular incandescent filament bulbs was dramatic.  As much as I would like to reduce my lighting power consumption which would, of course, greatly increase the time I could light my coach before having to charge my batteries, these won't do it for me.  Sadly, I must continue looking for warmer, brighter LED bulbs.",
				111: "Schumacher SEM-1562A 1.5 Amp Speed Charge MaintainerWell worth the price...does exactly what it is suppose to do.(Update) After using this charger less than 5 mos. to maintain my R.V., which is seldom driven, I have found that, because of the charger failing to cycle back to the charge mode properly, the battery that it was hooked to was stone dead. Now, I'll do some research to find out the annoying process of returning the charger for warranty.(Update) I have contacted the manufacturer, Schumacher, concerning the failure of this charger but after 3 weeks, have received no response and it doesn't look like I am going to. So, I guess I'll just take the loss of making a bad choice and trash it. BTW, I am using two Chicago Electric on Board chargers, one on my Jeep and the other on my Mercury Sable. Both are giving very good service and are less expensive than the Schumacher or the Battery Tender.",
				112: "I purchased this tire gauge becuase I wanted a digital display gauge that provides1 psi resolution. While the Accutire MS-4021B generally does the job, there are two annoying features that should be changed :<br>1. Batteries cannot be replaced by the user<br>2. On some valve stems, the Accutire MS-4021B does not make a seal to get an accurate reading<br>Ref. #1 : you have to send the gage in to the manufacturer who will replace the batteries free of charge. However, their turnaround time is more than two weeks, and I had to call their service department both times I had batteries replaced to get a replacement tire gauge.Furthermore, the batteries do not last more than a year or so, but I use tha gauge on a weekly basis for all my vehicles<br>Ref. #2 : this appears to be due to the chuck design, i.e. the contact pin does notprotrude far enough to allow a positive seal on some valve stemsI am still searching for a digital tire gauge that allows the user to replace the batteries",
				113: "I recently purchased an RV (my first one) and had very little hot water coming from my Atwood water heater. One of the suggestions to solve the issue was to flush the water heater tank. I did that first by letting the water out and refilling a few times but it did not correct the problem. I ordered the Camco Rinser and tried it next. The rinser is extremely simple to use. The built in shut off lever makes it a breeze to make sure you don't get water all over yourself or your coach while rinsing the tank. I was amazed that for a less than 3 year old RV how much sediment and junk came flowing out when I used the rinser. Worth every penny of the price to keep your tank clean of corrosion and sediment.To follow up to my hot water problem, it turned out to be a simple bypass valve that was turned the wrong way under the sink however it was clear that this is a valuable and inexpensive way to keep your water heater in top shape.",
				114: "I guess that I'm \"Old School\" but this product is not for me. First:  As others have stated, spatter is a problem - no matter how careful you are. Second:  There's not a lot of surface contact area, so it takes a long time to get anywhere. Third:  Even if you are careful in squezing out the ball after you wash it, it takes a very long time (days) to dry out. My suggestion is to take some fluffy old athletic socks and do the job by hand.  That's a lot of work, but it seems to go faster than with the ball - it's also easier to judge where you have been.Disclaimer - My experience is limited and I have only tried this product on an old car that has set unwaxed for nearly 30 years.  If your car is newer and the paint has been kept up, you may have better luck with the ball.  I plan to try it on a Honda CR-V with nice paint and will provide an update following that. Hopefully the next experience will be magical...",
				115: "The Meguiar's car products have always been satisfactory for me, so I looked forward to trying their Water Spot Remover.  I tested it on a Legacy the same color as the product container and for fun on a white washing machine that somehow has plenty of water spots.Applying product by hand as I did is a little bit of work, like applying a rubbing compound. User is advised to not let the product dry, advise I followed to the letter.  After applying  the water spot remover, I removed it with several wipings with a microfiber towel.Most water spots came off with the first application. Some areas required a second rubbing with the water spot remover. The treated surfaces were shiny and smooth. Meguiar's suggests protecting the treated surfaces with their ultimate wax. I used another brand of wax with good results.Bottom line - It's a little extra work, but the results of using this water spot remover will be worth the effort for most users. Even our old washing machine now has a smooth, shiny finish.",
				116: "I ordered and paid for next day air because I needed it this weekend.  It arrived, but it wasn't what I ordered.  I ordered a pair of jack stands.  I received an engine hoist leveler.I understand mistakes happen.. but it was the way the return has been handled that I have issues with.  UPS dropped it off, but I have to take it to the post office to send it back?  And I wasn't told if they'll wait to ship the right order until they receive this back via the slowest mail service.. so I have no idea when the replacement order will arrive.  A week?  Two weeks?This wasn't my mistake or even a defective product.. this was human error on their part.  They should have told me they'd IMMEDIATELY ship the replacements next day like I ordered.  So far I'm left hanging.  Should I go out locally and get what I need and then end up with an extra set?  Should I hold off a day because they're coming next day?  I don't know.. and that's the point and that's why I gave them this score.",
				117: "These wiper blades are extremely sturdy and do a great job of clearing the windshield in rainy conditions. Not sure yet about snow as it's still summer here,  but I'm pretty certain they'll do a great job at that too.  The fit the windshield very snugly and have a very strong arc in them. If your wiper arm is not extremely strong, however, they may not fit the curvature of your windshield and thus leave a gap in the clearing action.All the necessary installation \"how to\" is in the package. Along with the blade comes various parts to fit a variety of wiper arms with the instructions for all of the types.  I don't mind the pink ribbon on the blade and it's really not noticeable unless you fixate on it. As another reviewer wrote, if you want to get rid of it just cover it with a sharpie marker swipe.I'd recommend these with a caveat, that I have not tried them out in winter just yet.",
				118: "I didn't know this was what was already on my car when I bought another to replace it. After removing the cap I found moisture had made its way into the components inside, under the cap. I would take an educated guess that it was due to an inferior o-ring or bad vent cap that came with the cap, see my other review. There was some oxidation on various parts and even some rust, which I've never seen in any other vehicles I've owned over the past 20 yrs. This rotor was a PITA to remove! Due to the lousy cap, the rotor was rusted on and had to be cut off. Even after installing the new one, I tried to remove it just out of curiosity and it was very hard to remove. I've never had this problem with OEM parts. I won't buy this rotor or the matching cap again.",
				119: "The hitch pin locks are wonderful.  High quality, durable, and weather proof.  But if I had to do it over, I might just buy the pin locks (Master Lock Key Alike Set with Receiver and Coupler Latch Locks, 2-Piece Set #2848DAT) without the coupler lock.  First of all, the coupler lock doesn't really deter someone from stealing your RV trailer if they are determined.  You can simply connect the chains to a vehicle and drive off or just cut the coupler lock off.  I use the claw for real security (Tire Claw XL Lock #491KA - ATV, Auto, Trailer Locks).  Therefore, the only thing the coupler lock does is deter the casual thief if you don't use the claw.  The ball is grey plastic with a steel inner, which should work well.  I find that when it's in place, it hangs down and looks kind of floppy.  I may just end up using the hitch pin locks and claw only and forget the coupler lock.",
				120: "It does work, but is Poorly designed!! Using the a/c power, the d/c cord has to be removed from it's storage to get to the on switch. Very inconvenient! The a/c cord and the air hose should both be about 6 feet longer. Who wants to get out an extension cord every time they want to plug it in? The coupler on the air hose is very flimsy, cheap and can't last long. The previous model air station was so superior to the new one and it was made in the USA! It was a/c power only but had long cords and hoses and wrap around storage for them. The switch was easy to get to. That thing was used almost daily, like any other home appliance. New one needs re-designed again to be much more user friendly, and made with better quality materials, such as a metal coupler and re-in-forced air hose. Sorry, I just think a company like Black & Decker could have done worlds better. Thanks!<br>Pros<br>Ac or dc powered<br>Cons<br>Ac cord is way too shortAir hose is way too short",

				1: "I was initially given this product as a gift for my 9 pound chihuahua. It's great in the sense that it contains him very well. He is very active and likes to jump very high, but he can not jump over the gate. He tries to push the gate in attempt to escape but the gate does not move. The gate is high enough so that he can not jump over. It contains his crate, wee-wee pad and food bowl with plenty of room for him to play around in. I bought a second one to use as a gate to keep him from going up our stairs. Very sturdy product and we plan on using this also when we have kids. One drawback is the gate is a little difficult to open at times in case you want to just walk in. But I guess that is the good thing also so who ever you have inside can't get out.",
				2: "We received as a gift, so our annoyance is probably moderated. This review is for product misrepresentation.<br>-- Only received 1 out of 2 volcanoes.<br>-- Image provided with the expressive boy in red shirt is completely misleading. There is no \"play mat,\" but rather a thin piece of rectangular plastic that is more like an over-size disposable place-mat. Only large enough for half the pieces. The scene is completely different from that image. The real image has none of the detail.<br>-- \"Rocks\" are completely useless three-sided thin pieces of grey sides, thus no bottoms and sometimes missing a side altogether. Only received 10 out of 12, but not really missing them. <br>Half the dinosaurs are very small (1-2 inches) and the other half are more medium range (3-6 inches). Some people commented of the usefulness of the names printed on the undersides, but we have encountered 2 other brands that provide the same labeling, so that appears to be a given with a variety pack.The use of the big names \"Animal Planet\" and \"Toy R Us\" should be a tip-off. Over-priced small dinosaurs, 6 trees, and a small plastic bin.",
				3: "This was about as thick as his cozy baby blanket. There was nothing &#34;UltraSoft&#34; or &#34;UltraThick&#34; about this mattress pad, if you could call it that. It's probably the first amazon purchase, after a couple hundred, that really left me disappointed. You're better off putting a thick, soft blanket under your baby's crib sheet if padding is what you're going for. As a mattress protector, it might be good. As a quilted pad to make it softer- it's useless. The packaging it came in is less than 1.5 inches thick if that gives you any indication as to how thin the entire thing can be folded up to. My 7 month old wouldn't have even noticed a difference. He naps SO well on our Tempurpedic with a down topper that I wanted to get him a little something to soften his mattress with now that he's older. Guess I'll have to keep looking.",
				4: "I think that I've tried every bag that I have found and have been disappointed with all of them.  These were just about the worst!!  My daughter was born prematurely and never really got the hang of breastfeeding.  I wanted her to recieve all of the benefits of breastmilk so I pumped.  I have pumped everday since the day she was born btwn 5 and 8 times a day.  I went through ALOT of bags (I use bottles now) and these were a pain.  They were small, thin, punctured easily, and those twist ties (although pumping directly into the bag is a great concept) were just a pain in the butt.  I love Medela's pumps (I own the Pump in Style Advanced, a seperate manual pump, and used the Lactina hospital pump for 3 months), I like their storage bottles, I even like their nipple cream, but these bags need some more work put into them.",
				5: "We chose to use the Playtex Nurser Drop-Ins system because of convenience and sanitation. I'm so glad we did! We've been using the 4 ounce liners for 4.5 months now and we have never had one leak or break. They're very easy to use and reduce my time doing dishes. I've used the 8-10 ounce liners a few times as well with no issues. For those curious about measurements, it's very close to the measurement on the Medela bottles I pump into and Nuk bags. Sometimes after pouring milk into the liners they will expand just a tad more once the weight of the milk pushes the crinkles out, but it's not a large amount at all. I've used the 4 oz Up and Up Target brand liners as well, but when these are on sale at Babies R Us they are usually cheaper than buying the generic from Target.",
				6: "I've got a 2 week old.  We started with the Playtex Nurser Bottles.  Great bottles, but the nipple was way too large for my son's mouth and he got a blister on his top lip.  So I tried Gerber for newborns...smaller nipple, but more bubbles and gas for baby.  So I bought this VentAire because it has a smaller nipple AND is good for gas.  But my son sucked on it for 5 minutes and got nothing out of it.  Then I realized that the nipple doesn't just have a hole in it like other bottles do.  It has the slit-type hole, and the baby has to be squeezing the very tip if anything's going to come out.  Well babies don't suck that way.  They suck at the wider part, naturally.  But we solved our problem by taking the nipple off of the Gerber bottle and use it on the VentAire bottle.  (They tell you not to do this.) But it works perfectly now...no gas, no sucking problems.  Whew!",
				7: "My daughter couldn't get anything out of this bottle and it frustrated her. I thought at first it was bc we were trying to introduce her to the bottle (she used one when first born until I got my mastitis under control but we didn't keep up with it) at first she used avent, I liked those bottles but she refused them later on. She tried so hard with this bottle where she wouldn't give advent a chance. Same as many others I read on here, half hour she got half an ounce. We got dr browns and instant success! There's something that doesn't set well with me when you aren't supposed to steam sterilize this bottle. It's junk, and I'm glad to see it wasn't just my daughter struggling to drink from this bottle. I am only trying to get her on a bottle bc i have to get my wisdom teeth pulled and won't be able to nurse her for 24hrs. It'll also be handy to be able to pump and bottle feed her when we move in a couple weeks. Go with Dr browns if you are transitioning your baby to a bottle, you won't be sorry!",
				8: "I purchased this while pregnant because I could not see spending $40 for a Boppy.  I was not able to use this as a nursing pillow because it was too bulky for me, but I did use it for tummy time when my son was a newborn.  He is now 10 months old and I use it for play time, I plop him down on it, let him crawl over it, etc.  I never used the strap because it is a U shaped pillow and is already self-containing so I don't know why you need a strap?  Anyway, there is a pouch for the strap to go in and my son makes a game out of pulling it out after I tuck it away.  Overall, I like this pillow and I would recommend it for anyone interested in a Boppy.  I do have to say that I purchased my pillow at Wal-Mart for about $20 and it has a brightly colored jungle theme, so I cannot comment on the specific color/style being sold on Amazon.",
				9: "We got these to hold our daughter's treats when we decided we were going through too many plastic ziploc bags.  They were much better than a plastic sandwich bag in terms of durability and life cycle.  However, we still found that we ran into the same problem of the snacks being knocked out (or dumped out) when out and about.  For taking snacks on the go, we found that theMunchkin Two Snack Catchers, Colors May Varyworked better for our needs, especially when it comes to preventing spills.  The downside to those is that they aren't air-tight so the food can go stale. So, you really have to determine what you are buying this for.  If you are getting it to prevent spills, there are a lot better options out there.  If you are simply looking to replace ziploc bags with something more durable and eco-friendly that will still keep the snacks from going stale, then this is a great product.",
				10: "I bought this to put under the car seat in my new car. I had hoped it would help alleviate dents in the seat, as indicated on the product package. It did not. The car seat was in place for about 3 weeks and has left indents in the seat in spite of the protector. It is also not really large enough to catch spills. I use a Diono Radian, so the seat is about as narrow as you can get. Only a couple of inches stick out on either side. I also find the mesh pocket useless. The kid cannot reach it. And anything I might store in it, such as tissues, would get soggy and gross from dirty shoes. I am sure this is true of any protector, but installation can be tricky. It takes time and patience to get the car seat installed snuggly while keeping this protector in place. I usually have a good experience with Munchkin products, but I would not recommend this. I don't know if it's a case of &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;, but it definitely did not do the job stated on the box.",
				11: "I bought this booster seat because there was so seams or cracks for food to get into, and it appeared easy to clean.  I also liked that there was no seat belt as my son doesn't need the seat belt and it's just one more thing to get in the way and to clean.  All in all this booster does a nice job.  The sides are easy to clean and it's comfy for him.  My gripes are that I wish it had straps to hold it on to the chair, as it tips easily if he tips, and it usually ends up on the floor when he gets down.  Also, it has a rougher surface (not uncomfortable though) where he sits, I'm guessing to help keep his butt from sliding.  That rougher part is harder to wipe clean.  The only way I can get it clean it to submurse it in water.  Otherwise the sides of the seat wipe down easily.  All in all it's what I was looking for and it meets my expectations.",
				12: "I am currently 26 weeks pregnant with twins, but have been having trouble sleeping since about 10 weeks. Every morning I wake up with my hips killing me. Recently I had to stay in the hospital for about 10 days. During that time, my hip pain disappeared, I thought it was because I propped pillows against all of the bed rails so my body was more supported instead of putting so much pressure on my hips. When I got home I ordered this lifesaver, because it looked like it could mimic the support the bed rails offered. It gives support in all of the right places! The only gripe I have is that the seam is very tight, especially at the bridge where your neck/shoulder rests so it kind of cuts in to the skin. If it gets to be something I can't deal with I will probably just cut the pillow and sew in a little velcro to relieve the tension. Overall- a great product.",
				13: "I wanted to like this gate- I like the features but sadly it did not meet my hopes. first off- its way cheaper elsewhere. also the plastic is very cloudy- not see through at all which I expected it to be. I use it for the bottom of my stairs and I looked everywhere for a walk- through gate that did not have a bar that goes along the floor since I am very clumsy. I used it pressure mounted first and it pulled the paint off the wall from being too tight a fit or fell over being too loose a fit- it never seemed right. so we mounted it to the wall and that was a pain! When it is hardware mounted it does swing nicely and my kids cannot figure this gate out- they have been able to figure out the other gates opening mechanisms! I would only recommend this gate for specific circumstances.",
				14: "I like the look and feel of this seat, unfortuantely that is the only positive things I can say about it. First, the seat does not fit properly on a standard size toliet, I've tried every possible orientation. It slips and slides all over the place, not helpful when trying to convience a toddler that the toliet is a safe place. Second, the \"potty whole\" for lack of a better term is really small, if my toddler was able to use it, I'm not sure all the \"yuck\" would not get all over the seat. Lastly, my son hates the pee-pee shield on the front. I think this is a good idea to have with a little boy, but because the whole is so small the shield ends up scrapping and agiating him. ALSO, this shield should be removeable, you just don't need it for a little girl. Needless to say, I'm now looking for a new potty seat. :(",
				15: "This play mat just sucks. My son got it for Christmas. I returned it within the week. The fabric is cheap, the toys aren't anything special, and it isn't sturdy. AT ALL. Everytime he would bat at a toy the toy bar would come crashing down onto him, and he was playing very gently. I tried repeatedly to balance the mat and toy bar \"just so\" so that it wouldn't fall, to no avail. And the advertisement that you can attach the toy bar to the crib? Well, i'm a pretty intelligent adult and I could never get it to stay attached to a crib without looking really tacky. I returned it and bought the fisher price precious planet play mat that has three bars that connect in the middle for about $35 and have had no issues with it. It has alot more toys, collapses well too, and is ALOT better quality. So, for $15 dollars more, my son has a better quality toy that he can enjoy without getting bonked and me having to hold the toy bar up so it won't hit hom in the face.",
				16: "I purchased 2 of these bibs and really wanted to like them, but ending up returning them and keeping the Bibbity bibs instead.  The pocket on this bib is fantastic, and catches most of the dropped food.  However, I ended up returning these bibs because as other reviewers stated, the neck is too rough.  The material is a very hard plastic, which is fine for the bib, but not for the enclosure around the neck.  My son didn't seem to mind this bib around his neck, but I chose the softer material of the Bibbity bib instead.  This bib did stay in place around my son's neck, but when he pulled on the bib, I thought he was going to get a mark on his neck from the hard plastic.  This is an ok bib that could be great if the neck enclosure was changed.",
				17: "I'm beyond sad.  I love these bibs.  They are the only ones I've found that don't leak drool onto my LO's clothes, but I just discovered the red one bled all over one of my LO's best white outfits.  (I did prewash the bibs and he wore it one other time over a black shirt so it's been washed at least twice before bleeding) I'm hoping it will wash out, but I'm not holding my breath.  I haven't noticed a problem with the other colors and I have the boy and girl color set.  (I haven't used the pink girl ones though.) I'll still continue to use these bibs, but I might look harder for another waterproof absorbent bib if I were to buy more.  (Though, I'm not sure if there is anything else out there.) My other complaint about these is that the velcro closes in the middle.  I much prefer bibs that move the velcro over to the side so it is not right behind the baby's head and it's easier to get on and off.",
				18: "I bought this brush thinking it would be better than the Dollar Store brush we were currently using.  How completely wrong I was!  This brush is wide and incredibly stuff.  I tried to shove it into our standard VentAire bottles and it wouldn't fit at all.  I could have used some major elbow grease and probably gotten it in the actual bottle, but realized that even if I did that I'd still have to get it OUT and I was too concerned with the stiff bristles ruining my bottle while I was trying anyway.  There was absolutely no way this would work with my pump flanges so I didn't even go there.  I actually ended up using this brush to wash a few pots and pans (which it did a poor job of) and then chucked it after a week or two.  Complete waste of money.",
				19: "Our other car seat bag is the Eddie Bauer one. Getting a full sized carseat into the Sunshine Kids bag is as much of a wrestling match as it is with the Eddie Bauer bag; however, the Eddie Bauer bag is made of far better materials. We thought we'd take a chance with this since the Eddie Bauer bag is now tough to find and more $$$ + this Sunshine Kids bag got decent reviews. The EB one has held up to many trips where the people in baggage have dragged it across the pavement... The Sunshine Kids bag however did not. The bag was very worn, but not ripped after our first flight. When we attempted to put in the carseat for our return flight, the bag riped in the biggest wear spot. In fact, just the stress of trying to get the seat in the bag caused a rip nearly the full length of the bag. The airline had to put it all into a plastic bag b/c it was such a useless mess. So, all these people who left glowing reviews are just lucky...that's all. This product is a total piece of junk!!!!!!!!",
				20: "I love the design/look of this, but we also had problems with soap leaking out.  No real problem since we keep liquid soap in the bath anyway.  The big problem was with it falling off.  I contacted customer service and they were very helpful offering suggestions, though they did not offer a refund since it had been several months since the purchase.  We are still using it and it is pretty stable after I wrapped a few rubber bands around the faucet (under the Boon Flo) and one around the back. I do not mind this setup, but find it disappointing to have to deal with it for a product at a higher price point.  We are still using it more than 2 years after purchase though, since it does work with the modifications.  If I'd spent less initially, I would have given it a higher rating even with the problems. I do enjoy the \"waterfall\" effect, though honestly I wish I'd just purchased a cheaper blowup/plastic cover to start.",
				21: "I bought this in blue and pink for my boy/girl twins and I'm very disappointed.  The hand print/footprint kits are okay, though I wish it came with more cards for mistakes since it took us many tries to get a good print for either baby.  I like that there's a place for a picture and hand print/footprint on the cover.  I don't like how the pages don't lay down nicely and you have to bed the page to get it to lay flat.  This is especially a problem since the places for pictures are on the back sides of the pages and if you're using photo corners to add a picture, you really need the page to lay flat.  I also wish there were more prompts for things like baby's first ______. I'm going to get rid of these and use Hallmark's baby book instead.  It has more prompts, it's has three ring binding so the pages lay flat, and there are places for pictures on both sides of the pages.  This book, unfortunately, made for an expensive hand print/footprint kit since it's going in the trash!",
				22: "I started using this about a week ago with my 5 1/2 month old son. He has 3 teeth and is working on the 4th! I was worried about using the brush with his gums being so sensitive with the new tooth breaking through but he LOVES it! The \"bristles\" are much softer than they appear in the picture. I use just a tiny bit of the paste and start massaging his teeth and gums. He likes to hold my finger and \"do it himself\" too. Now when he sees me get out the finger brush he gets excited! Hopefully we are setting good hygeine habits for the future! The only downside I have is that the finger brush is a little big for me which is weird because I have rather large fingers for a female. I just make sure to hold onto it with my thumb so it doesn't come off in baby's mouth. It's not enough of a problem for me to reduce my rating though. Happy brushing!",
				23: "I bought this for my baby brother, Jay. He is my Mom's 1 year old foster child who she is in the process of adopting. Here is what my Mom said about the gate: \"The gate seemed OK but was very light weight plastic and we didn't think it was sturdy enough to keep a strong baby like Jay from breaking it out of the wall and then tumbling with it down the steps.  Most importantly, the gate was not very tall, only about 24\" I think,  The railing around the top of the steps is more like 32\".  We felt that baby would be hanging over the top of the gate and fall down the steps (Jay is already 33 inches tall).\" They ended up buying a different gate, so it was a waste of money for me. If I lived in the same state, I would just bring it home to use in my house for my baby since we don\'t have any stairs.",
				24: "Jacques is a pretty cool peacock. lol. Its a normal toy - well stitched and I don't think that there is any potential part that I have to worry about that is a choke hazard. There is very little bunting that can come out. What surprised me is that this toy is pretty big (for my 3 month old anyways). The feathers make that crinkling sound and the squeaker is not annoying. Hard to press for a baby though. It also has a small rattle. Not too noisy at all. The back of Jacques is pretty nice too. Its black and white patterns of circles, triangles and stripes. I want to get Fifi the firefly also but for now I think Jacques is sufficient. Also, Jacques comes with us to many outings because the toy has a round ring that you can easily attach to the mommy hook and it never falls out of the carseat. Score!",
				25: "My son did love this swing and I loved the fact that it plugged into the wall. And then the motor broke. I used it for six months. My son wasn't ready to stop using it but I opted to use the crib full time at this point. I would have liked the opportunity to sell it, but who wants a broken swing? All the other features work: lights, music. While it worked he did love it. I used a graco for my daughter that was handed down a couple of times already and it never broke. I would have used it with my son, but it was pink. All in all, it was a really good swing but be ready for the hassle in case the motor gives. BTW he was less than 15 pounds when it broke and the max weight is 25.",
				26: "Fisher-Price is well known for making toys that \"grow\" with their toughest critics, babies.  The Fisher-Price Rainforest 123 Musical Gym is no exception.  My son is four months old, and he loves to lie on his back and swat at the toucan rattle, butterflies, and tiger music box.  He coos and giggles while he plays with them.  There's also a giraffe and palm tree that he likes to look at.  As he grows older and begins to lie on his belly more, there's another rattle, a mirror, and a peek-a-boo toy to play with as well.  There's even a headrest that can move along with the child as they grow.This toy focuses on development of large motor skills.  The ability for the toy to \"grow\" with the child makes it a pretty good buy in my opinion.  I recommend it to families with babies who are at least two or three months old.",
				27: "I have an UPPA VISTA, the handle bars are at a 45 degree angle with no bend in them. The Jolly Jumper fits on the handle bars but the bag also sits at a 45 degree angle. Basically, this would work if I always carried around a drink with a cap on it but never an open container. If you have a stroller that will hold the bag level it will probably work better for you. Aside from the angle of the handle bars, I wasn't thrilled with it in general. The cup holders are not large enough to fit larger coffee cups or even larger water bottles. There is nothing that really gives the caddy any structure so the bottom part swings while the top stays rigid, making things bounce around. I tried this caddy head to head with the Sunshine Kids Buggy Buddy (which is cheaper) and found that caddy to be better material, better structure and the cup holders stretch to hold larger cups.",
				28: "When I had my first baby, I thought I just had to have the chicco pack and play that matched our car seat, because it had all of the cool things like a big toy bar and music and lights. And let me just tell you I HATED IT. It's so heavy and bulky and all of those extra parts are just more weight and bulk for you to drag around. This Graco model is basic, no frills, and a fraction of the price and I like it much better. It's lighter and folds easier, it was very quick to assemble unlike the chicco, and it's very good quality. You really do not need the changing table and music and fancy toy bar that a lot of the more expensive pack n plays come with. Those features seem nice but honestly you won't use them. When it's 2 in the morning you aren't going to be trying to flip up the changing pad to change that diaper, and your baby isn't going to care about the toy bar or the music player",
				29: "5/1/2012: We've had these pacifiers since Super Bowl weekend (beg of Feb). We do love them, but they do require more work to clean, so we don't use them as often. True, they don't fall open on the floor, but they still need to be washed. You have to wash them in warm soap water, so it takes more time than the dishwasher. Not a lot more time, but with babies, it's hard to find time to do this sometimes. Only other issue, they don't always close when they hit the floor. Usually they do, but it's about a 5% chance it doesn't close, espcially if it's on carpet. Otherwise, good product. I wouldn't pay the $7 I did for the baseball one again, but the $4 ones are okay on price. PS: You also can't have the baby sleep with this pacifier because it closes and they can't open it on their own until about 11/12 months.",
				30: "I've invested a small fortune in Dr. Brown's products (bottles, warmer, sterilizer, drying rack, mixing pitcher, and formula dispenser!), and thankfully all of those items that were paid for worked out really well.  This bottle brush came free with the bottles I purchased, and I'm glad it did--I would've been really disappointed if I'd spent any money on it. The issues I had were: <br>1.  the sponge at the top disintegrated after about 3 weeks of regular use<br>2.  water and soap sprays everywhere when you remove the brush from a bottle<br>3.  the bristles on the brush weren't dense enough to really clean the bottles well<br>After a few weeks, I gave up on it and purchased the Philips AVENT BPA-Free Bottle Brushinstead--the bristles are really dense, and they're only around part of the brush, so if you pull it out with the bristles faced-down, they don't spray on you at all.",
				31: "This comes in two pieces: the tray and the bottom piece that attaches to the Bumbo seat.  I don't care what anyone says - the tray does not attach to the bottom half of this product!  There is NO give in the plastic, so attachment is nearly impossible.  Trust me, we tried!  It looked good in theory, but since the snap doesn't work, I wasn't comfortable using this.  I bet you can get away with jamming the tray on and it probably won't pop off the bottom piece of plastic, but I wouldn't risk it, especially if you have a wiggly baby. I had to return it.  I was sorry to do so because my baby likes sitting in her Bumbo and wants to have toys.  I had hoped the tray would mean less time picking up toys from the floor and having to wash them off.  Oh well! *sigh*",
				32: "We have bi-fold glass doors through out the house. So when I saw this product, I immediately thought this is perfect. Counted all doors and ordered accordingly just to return all of them when they arrived. Thankful for amazon's wonderful return policy to not create any problem. May be I was wrong in purchasing this as I think its designed for thick wooden doors. Don't know if it will work with them but it certainly does not work with the glass doors. The lock goes into the place without any problem, instructions are a little difficult to understand but you can figure it out if you follow the diagram carefully. After putting the lock on the door, when I opened the door, the lock traveled with the door. I was not able to open the door completely but the lock misses the purpose by letting the door open even slightly. Those little fingers will certainly get pinched with this lock. Overall design is good. Look gets mixed with the door because of transparent color.",
				33: "This mat does what I wanted - provides a softer surface for my child to play on than the hardwood floor.  The mat does slide across my floor easily, which is both good when I want to move it and bad if someone is running across it.  The pieces fit together well, you can alternate randomly or make a pattern with the squares and circles.  My friend brought her 4 year old son over and we turned it into a puzzle game.  After getting the mat together he liked taking the circles out and putting them into matching color squares.  I'd alternate them somehow and he'd match them up again.  Lots of entertainment out of something I thought would just be a rug.  But some of the negative reviews are right.  It does scuff pretty easily, but it washes well also.  I've set heavier things on it, leaving indentations, but they fade with time... maybe not all the way depending on severity.  Right now, this product is great for my 7 month old, we'll see how it lasts!",
				34: "I had an evenflo monitor for the first 20 months but it fizzled out on me recently and when I went to find another one, apparently evenflo doesn't make it anymore.  So I tried the Safety First monitor, it was cheap and I couldn't get a clear signal.  Then I tried a Graco Monitor and I had the same problem.  Finally decided to spend a little bit more and went with this monitor.  I am soooo happy with it.  It's sturdy and solid feeling, I have no problem with static or finding a signal.  The rechargeable battery is priceless.  I do feel like the range alarm goes off a little bit too much, I'm only 3 rooms away from my son's room and it will signal sometimes.  But other than that I am so pleased with this monitor,  As a parent, it seems you have this thing in arms reach at all times so it's really reassuring to find a product I am happy with.",
				35: "Unfortunately, this is the worst high chair I&#8217;ve ever had the misfortune to own. The tray is difficult to slide onto the armrests, you&#8217;ll often get one side in and not the other, it always takes me several attempts. Crumbs and mushy food easily get stuck in corners of the armrests, the footrest, and the inside rim of the main tray making it difficult to clean. The lift off tray top should be designed to cover the entire tray as the exposed sides of the main tray end up getting dirty and grimy after each meal. After owning the highchair for 2 days the buckle jammed on one side. My baby was small enough that I was able to pull him out with only one side unbuckled, but I then spent about forty minutes attempting to unbuckle the stuck side. Still stuck and still waiting to hear back from customer service about it&#8230;I have used several other high chairs that do not have as many issues as this one.Pros: Easy to collapse for storage, baby seems comfortable in the seat, height adjustment feature",
				36: "Received this co-sleeper the other day.  Absolutely beautiful durable nylon fabric and an intelligent design that allows you to unfold and collapse this thing without a single tool.  It was a bit involved the first time, but I can see how it would get easier each time you fold and unfold it. The polyester liner has cheap-quality though -- I expected a cotton one. Also, the polyurethane foam mattress is totally unacceptable to me because polyurethane foam is quite toxic, and this mattress is surely full of toxic fire-retardants.  I am planning to buy the organic mattress for the co-sleeper that ARC makes -- but the price tag of $130 is outrageous, considering I already paid $169 for the co-sleeper with a mattress!  Paying $300 just so my that baby can sleep next to me for five to six months on a non-toxic mattress??  That's a little steep I must say! ARC should include a non-toxic mattress off the bat!",
				37: "I was really disappointed upon receiving this at the size of the travel crib when packed away. I was hoping for something we could take on an airplane with us as a carry on, this is not the solution that allows for that. It is much too big. It must be checked, which in this age of paying for checked bags this is just one more thing we would have had to pay to check. We sent it back. The mattress appeared plush and the crib seemed like it would do serve it's purpose well as a sleeping place, but it just wasn't airline travel friendly in our opinion. If we drove while traveling we would have kept this crib. But with the number of times airlines have lost my bags if I had to check our travel crib when flying I'd also have to have a backup plan on where my baby could sleep when the airline lost the crib. We ended up with the GuavaFamily GoCrib and it's fantastic!!",
				38: "When breastfeeding, these are highly recomended. The problem with a breastfeeding mom is, they do not fit standard US breast pumps. So basicly you have to pump into one bottle, then transfer into this one (this causes a problem for those of us who don't produce quite enough milk --- every drop that is lost in transfer is crutial). Then you are faced with the leaking problem. The directions say to wet the rim to prevent leaking. Well, sometimes that works and sometimes it dosen't. Again, I am reminded of how delicate every drop of milk was. Sometimes these bottles will taunt you. I would test the bottle before giving it to baby... then after I was convinced it wouldn't leak... baby would begin to suck and would instantly be drownded! And there you are, wasted milk, and a hungry baby who is drenched, and really mad by the time you get another bottle ready and her clothes changed!!! The day I stopped breast feeding I switched to playtex vent aire, which only leak once in a blue moon, if you dont put it together right.",
				39: "Very pleased so far, I'm a new dad and after extensive research, friend's recomendations and reviews these car seat has made our life very easy, it performs as advertised, it is light (at least for me), seems to be very comfortable for our daugther who sleeps on it for long periods of time, it seems to keep the baby very worm (great for winter), easy to install, good quality of materials, hard plastic and elegant yet resistant fabric, seems very safe, instructions put lots of emphasis on safety. The entire cover comes off for easy cleaning in the washer machine. It fits securely in the Babytrend stroller frame (new parents out there this is the lightest & easiest folding frame, better than graco's) my wife and mother in law are very comfortable using the car seat. It's been 5 weeks and we are very pleased, hope this helps, good luck with your baby!",
				40: "I purchased these based on the great reviews on Amazon.  When I received the burp clothes they were great.  Small but very absorbent.  Then after a few washes, the threads started showing.  After I cut the loose threads, and wash them some more, it's falling apart more.  I don't even bother cutting the threads anymore. Burp clothes must be able to handle constant washings and these do not hold up.  I'm very disappointed.  In addition, they were already small to begin with and now they shrink some more.  With the loose threads and the shrinkage, I won't have much to work with anymore.  Considering they were $10 for something that lasted a month, it's not worth the money. My friend ended up recommending burp clothes by Ikea.  I purchased a few and they were double the size of the Dundee Burp Clothes and are just as absorbent.",
				41: "This stroller is brilliant. It's very easy to set up, within a couple minutes you're ready to roll. The wheels turn on a dime. The handles are long enough for both my husband (6' and me 5\'5\") and I to push without kicking the wheels. My daughter is 3 and loves riding in it. It\'s ability to stand up on it\'s own when folded makes it easy to take to restaurants or sports games and put it aside. The net underneath is big enough to store a kids backpack and your purse. It\'s great for travel, goes anywhere easily. We also have a quinny, that while I love it, this one is so much better for everyday use. It has all the benefits but is so much smaller and lightweight. Nevermind a one hand fold, this has a one finger fold. You pull the tab and it collapses, the safety keeps you from pulling the tab while anyone is in it. There\'s no cons for the stroller, I can\'t believe it\'s only $107!",
				42: "This is the Boppy Bounce in Comfort Bouncer, however, the description on Amazon is for the Boppy Cradle in Comfort Bouncer. So, I didn't realise they weren't quite the same thing. I was just sent this package and had put together before I realised that the music/sound component wasn't what I wanted. Aside from the ability to bounce and the softness of this device, the reason I wanted it was the soothing sounds. However, this item only has one selector so all you get is the music. Also, I assume that the music cycles through all 5 tunes that are mentioned on the package? I didn't bother to listen as the first tune was just dire. Bottom line: If you like the idea of soothing sounds, don't buy this product. I have returned mine and indicated to Amazon the incorrect descriptor on the website. Other than this issue, the product looked a good buy for the price. The colour of the material was a bit ho hum but that wouldn't have caused me too much angst. At least it was neutral which was what I wanted.",
				43: "We've been using this for several years and bought another one because we had another child. Overall, contains the smell IF THE LID IS CLOSED. If you open the lid to put a diaper in, the smell comes out and it's stinky. The design is awful too, you have to bend to put the diaper in and you have to shove your whole hand in to push the diaper past the two clamps. Also, I've had MANY an occasion where the bag inside split open and the room started to stink putrid and then I knew &#34;oh boy the bag has split&#34;. I open up the diaper genie and find poo/urine pooled in the bottom and I have to clean out the entire diaper genie. That's not exactly the diaper genie's fault, but it is the same company. Also, one of the two diaper genies had a lid that broke and we can't get it back on. If i had to do it over again, i would have tried a different pail.",
				44: "I just replaced our older monitor with this one and the difference is amazing.  This little monitor is crystal clear and doesn't produce any static.  I haven't had any of the problems of not immediately hearing my baby, but I do have the sensitivity set at 5.  What I don't like is the fact that it is super quiet, even at its highest setting.  It works for me because I have super sensitive hearing and usually have the monitor set very quiet, but I can see how that wouldn't work for someone else, that they might sleep through their baby fussing.  I have noticed that when my son is facing towards the monitor I can hear him breathing, but when he is facing away from it I can't.  I still think it's a great monitor and it works for us, just be cautious if you need something really loud. Update...We've now had the monitor for almost a year and I still love it!  There is no static at all, the battery still works fantastic.  I've been so happy with this monitor and think that it has been well worth the money spent.",
				45: "I had this item already and I am purchasing 2 more.  The brown is always on sale because no one wants that color I guess. I like it and have it in my son's crib.  It is plush yet not too hard and high that my son can boost himself up over the crib.  I am using these 2 I purchased to line the bottom part of the railings in my house in the areas he plays.  The railings have sharp edges where it is squared and transitions to grounded spindles.  Everyone in the house has already hurt themselves on it and it's only a matter of time before my son gets hurt on it.  Hopefully this will work out but I know for a fact that this item is a great buy and worth every penny.  It is soft, easy to clean, neutral, and does what it is meant to do.",
				46: "I've purchased four of these now, two I gave as gifts (oh God) and two I kept for us. The ones I kept both worked for about two months, then never worked again. The first one I let the baby hold in bed at night. It would charge during the day and I let it run out at night. That worked about a month, then it wouldn't charge any longer. The second one I was afraid to let the baby sleep with. I unplugged it and let it run all night about two or three nights a week and the other nights I just left it in the base and turned it on. That on lasted about two months before it stopped charging. I'm too embarrassed to ask the people I gifted them to, if theirs still work. I've wasted so much money on these. They are really cute when they work, but they are too expensive to be so unreliable. I had two of the older style and the same problem with one of those. Out of all of these that I purchased, only one still works.",
				47: "This is the hospital grade breast pump. I first time try this pump when our little one was in NICU for few days. Her bilirubin was too high after she was born for 3 days due to the dehydration that she couldn't get enough milk from my breast feeding. We were strictly  give her only breast feed at first but I (a new mom) didn't realize that my body didn't produce enough milk for her demands so she ended up admin to the hospital.  I was recommended to get this pump this model for home from the nurse in NICU. She told us that this is the best pump and many hospitals use it. And I totally agreed with her. I have used this pump steady every singel day and it has yet to fail me. After few days use I saw big improvement I can make more and more milk but still cannot keep up with her needs just pumping alone, but overall i am so happy with this product because we don't have to supplement much like before.",
				48: "I received the Dreambaby gate in white along with two- 3 1/2\" extensions as a gift when my son was born. Only recently did we need to install it and I realized that the gate would not fit the width I need (42\"). So I purchased this 7\" extension and paired it with the gate and only one of the smaller extensions and it fit perfectly. Putting it together wasn't too hard. At first I was a little confused (the directions have multiple languages for each section which clutters the page) but once I figured out how to pressure-mount it everything went smoothly. We have molding along the baseboards so I had to raise the gate slightly in order to make it lie flat but there have been no problems. It is very very tight on the wall and no wobbling. It takes a little while to get used to the gate (and the fact that you MUST step over the bottom part even when the gate is open) but it has been extremely effective to keep both my 11 month old and my dog out of the kitchen. Would absolutely recommend this product.",
				49: "I liked the look and feel of the Bundle Me Lite, but unfortunately it didn't fit my Maxi Cosi Mico car seat.  Specifically, the elastic that affixes the Bundle Me to the car seat did not have enough stretch, which resulted in the fabric that sits in the seat being pulled too taut (so taut that the baby would be suspended by the fabric instead of sitting back in the seat).  Also, the pre-cut holes did not line up with the car seat straps.  I figured that I could make it work somehow, but after struggling for a good 20 minutes, I realized that the product just wouldn't work for my seat. Another reviewer had mentioned this problem, and I just assumed they were doing something wrong.  Don't be as stupid as me - if you have a Maxi Cosi Mico car seat, just buy a different product to keep your little one warm.",
				50: "This is one of those tings new mommies look at and wonder, \"How did my parents ever survive without one of those?\" Then you buy it and you quickly learn it\'s because it\'s completely useless. I ended up keeping the binky on a clip that hooked to the baby's clothes whenever we went out. This kept it from falling, and also made it unnecessary for me to use a bag at all. If I needed to put it away, I just threw it in the diaper bag (which is clean, and I'm not a germaphobe). Also, the snap on the loop always came open, so I couldn't trust it on the diaper bag strap. That's the whole reason I thought it'd be cool...so I didn't have to dig through the diaper bag for the binky. But I ended up having to keep it in the bag anyway because it would just fall off. Now my older son thinks it's a cute purse and shoves little things in it.",
				51: "I am so disappointed with this carrier.  After reading the rave reviews, I couldn't wait to get this.  I tried it 3 different times, trying different positions and adjustments.  I hated it more and more with each time I wore it.  I think it might be related to the fact that I am very thin and petite and it just didn't fit my frame properly.  My poor 7 mo daughter was slipping down my body and I had to keep an arm under her to keep her up.  And the pain around my waist was downright unbearable.  It also pulled down the waistband of all of my pants and made it is so that my pants were literally falling off of me.  It's a great concept and very nicely made, the Picadilly Circus print is super cute.  I have given up on carriers and we just bought a backpack carrier for my husband instead that my little one loves!",
				52: "Everyone should have a set of these. It's perfect for when you're on the go and it's hard to hold your baby to feed them. Our son still needs burped so we can't just totally let him \"feed himself\" but all we have to do is give him the bottle, and pick him up once he's done so he can burp. It works great out at restaurants, or sporting events (we just used it while at a basketball game). It has also come in very handy for me a few mornings when my husband was not home to help out and I needed to get ready. My son was able to have his bottle while sitting in his rock'n play sleeper and I could keep getting ready for work. This would also be PERFECT for anyone with multiples!!!! Any baby who can suck on a pacifier can use this product. This is just a must have for any parents in my opinion.",
				53: "I love the idea of this product... I just don't love the price tag. My son loves his bear wubby and uses it all the time. He loves hugging its soft little body and squeezing its paws which is great since he is a little over 3 months and getting very handsy. The bear is very light weight with a small amount of beads in its feat that give it a little character when flopping about, but not enough weight to be too heavy for even the smallest infant. I am not sure what I was originally expecting but the animals are tiny... perhaps a little bigger then baby beanie babies at ~4-5 inches in length. To me it just looks tiny, but it seems to be a good size for him.I would love to see this company have more animal options as well as make the pacifier removable so that both the animal and the pacifier are easier to clean and be switchable.",
				54: "This arch is pretty cute.  I cannot get the sun toy to play the music like it's supposed to though.  I've changed the batteries several times and only gotten it to play a couple times.  Not sure what's wrong with it.  Also it seems it would be pretty difficult for my almost-5-month-old baby to press the sun to get it to play the music anyways.  The spiral wheel is fun but again, my baby can grab the pull, but cannot pull it hard enough to get the toy to turn.  Maybe when she's a little bigger.  It is easy to secure it to her rock n play sleeper and fits perfectly on it.  I haven't tried it with her carseat or stroller yet.  Reading other reviews, just thought it would be more than what it actually is.  Again, I like it.  don't love it.",
				55: "Not impressed. This backpack fails on several main factors.The shoulder straps should be padded. it cuts into the childs shoulders. If you were to pull on the leash it lifts the backpack up so high the chest strap could literally choke the child. My main reason for liking this backpack was it was a neutral black color for my little boy to wear and wasn't a cheesy style like most harness backpacks. I feel completely stupid holding onto the leash strap in public.im going to continue working on getting my son to stay with me and hold my hand. i never use the backpack but i did put it on him and test out its functionality to see if he liked wearing it. he seemed ok with it. If you are looking for a backpack specifically used for the harness/leash option i do not suggest this backpack. The zippers are smooth and function well. There is reflective stitching along all the areas where the backpack was stitched together for extra safety during night walking. the backpack is a good size for smaller children. My son is 15 months old and there is room for him to grow into it.",
				56: "Let me start by saying that my son really likes playing with this. It is a very engaging, fun toy for him. I am a little frustrated with it though. I bought this because I wanted a suction toy that would stick in place so I wouldn't have to constantly be picking up toys and putting them back on his high chair tray....but this doesn't stick very well. There are times that I've stuck the toy to the high chair and it loses suction and falls over on its own without even being touched *grumble* so you can imagine how easy it is for my baby to just grab it and pull it right off the tray....only to drop/throw it on the floor soon after, defeating the purpose of this toy... So yes-it is very cute and fun for the baby to play with. However, if I had known it was going to just end up being another noise making toy with moving parts, I wouldn't have bothered buying it.",
				57: "This is one of the simplest toys out there, but is so versatile. We have been using them for about 6 months. (son just turned 1). He has learned to nest them and can do just a very basic stacking. We haven't even used them in the bath yet and still think the value for these is off the charts. This is an easy recommend. So the reason I took away a star is for 2 reasons: 1) because the edges on a couple of the cups on the underneath side of the lip are little sharp. My son hasn't cut his mouth or anything yet, but he gnaws on these a lot (like pretty much every toy) so it would have been perfect it the edges were a little bit smoother. 2) Stacking these is pretty tricky. It will be great when he is older to build up his skills, but at 12months they are too difficult to really stack. Still a must have, so don't hesitate to grab some.",
				58: "this carrier is pretty comfortable to wear for long hikes. we have mostly gone with baby in the front. fits my husband and I with no problems. very adjustable which helps with preventing back pain, but usually by the end of the hike, I am ready to get it off. have only worn baby on the back a few times, haven't noticed any issues other than baby seems to sit kind of low in the back - maybe baby is not big enough yet. the only issue I have overall is that you can't put baby facing forward in the front. as they get older, babies like to face out. although I have heard there are some hip issues with babies that do face out in other carriers, the option would still be nice. not sure why the LED safety reflector light is included, it never stayed on so we never used it.",
				59: "I love these bags.  I have a wet bag for my diaper bag and then saw the recommendation to put a wet/dry bag in your swim bag.  Genius!! It will be so great for our wee one to have a dry diaper and clothes in one section of the bag, and then a place to put his wet suit in the same bag. Not to mention you can toss your keys, phone, book, etc., in the dry section and not worry about them getting wet.The fabric feels very durable and appear very well made.  Not to mention the designs are great!  I purchased a &#34;coral sunset&#34; for my wet/dry and the monkeys for the wet only.  I was a little hesitant to purchase because of the price, it seemed a little steep considering I have hundreds of plastic grocery bags I could use for dirty diapers on the go and wet swim suits, but when the bags arrived I absolutely loved them.  I really wish I had more uses for these bags because I'd buy more in a heartbeat.",
				60: "Wow I really, really wanted to like this toy for my 4 month old daughter. She has giraffes on the bedding in her room and she loves to look at them and babble so I though this toy would be the perfect extension of that, but after taking it out of the box, Sophie is going right back. First of all the quality is really dog- toy like. It smells!! And the paint was already rubbing off. I don't care if it is food-safe paint, I still don't want my child ingesting it. Also the squeaker is a dog- magnet. We have a big Siberian Husky that we are super diligent about supervising around our daughter. I certainly don't want to give her a toy that is going to bring the dog running every single time she squeezes it. This is our preference- But a good advise to other dog- cautious families.",
				61: "This stroller is really very nice.  It rides smoothly and folds easily.  The only issue I have with it is the fact that you Cannot fold the stroller when the seat is facing the parent.  You have to remove your child and turn the seat to face away from you before you can fold the stroller down.  Otherwise this is a really great stroller.  I'm 5'8\" tall and it's perfect for my walking stride, no kicking the stroller at all and the basket below the seat has plenty of space.  The strollers 5 point harness is easy to operate and it's a very comfy ride for your child all in all.  If you could fold the stroller with the seat facing the parent without having to turn it facing away from the parent I would have given it the full 5 stars.  It's a GREAT stroller for those of us who can't afford to spend the extra hundreds for a Bugaboo, etc.",
				62: "We were given a Halo Swaddle sleep blanket where you pin the baby's arms down and then wrap the other piece around and it secured with velcro in the back. She slept fantastic in this and was very soothed. However, when she grew out of it, I thought I would try the Woombie. I made the mistake of buying one on clearance, and now I can't return it. It was awful. My daughter could still move her arms and she would get them up by her face in an attempt to suck on her hands. The Woombie then was dangerously close to covering her mouth and nose. I couldn't stop worrying about her covering her face with the blanket that I paid for overnight shipping on the next size up of the Halo Swaddler and I couldn't be happier. I wouldn't buy one of these again. The designs are cute, but not enought restraint to make sure that your infant isn't covering up their face in the middle of the night.",
				63: "My 5 month old loves it. It doesn't rock as hard as her larger swing, but it's great for traveling. It folds up, it's very quiet, the music is peaceful and not very loud, it's easy to use, the timer on it is fantastic. She has issues with acid reflux so when she has a bad episode of it or needs extra comfort with teething. Cons-- where the middle strap (between the legs) where everything connects for the restraint is a bit awkward for her because it is so wide. She's on the smaller side so I don't see how it would be comfortable for an infant. It also says it has 2 positions. That's not true at all. Even if you set the seat up (the position it is when its folded up) it isn't secured at all and seems very unsafe. I would give 5 stars if those two issues were addressed.",
				64: "I bought this mat for my daughter when she was 4 months old. It's thick enough to be comfortable on hard wood floor. It is useful for just a cushioning mat, but it also has things to keep a baby entertained. I used it at first to sit her Discover and Grow Kick and Play on, so she would have room to roll around.  It is a nice size for her to play on. It is very bright and colorful and now that my daughter is rolling around more and can sit unsupported, she really enjoys it. Her favorite parts of the mat are the elephant ear and the water under the ducks. They are both made of crinkle paper and she will roll over and play with those bits. It is also easy to fold it back up into the carry bag and take it somewhere with you. I recommend this item over stinky toxic letter mats any day.",
				65: "I bought this for my son because I was searching for a better sucker than the bulb I received at the hospital.  Someone had suggested an electronic sucker, but after reading reviews, I decided to purchase this product. I must say, after 2 weeks with a snotty 7 month old child, this product is awesome!!!!!!  Sure, you have to suck pretty hard, but it's so much better than the quick bursts you get with a bulb syringe.  My son HATES his nose being touched, much less sucked.  He still screams bloody murder while I'm sucking him, but after a couple weeks of using this product, he calms down much quicker. I think it's because he feels so much better being able to breathe. The filters are kind of unnecessary, as someone else mentioned.  The snot doesn't get that far up.  Oh, and this product is disgusting... BUT... it works & makes the little one feel so much better afterwards.",
				66: "After seeing and owning a few OXO products in the kitchen, I have high expectations from the company. For the price, sure it's easy to discount the flaws. But I'd rather they charge a bit more to have a higher quality of material and build. It's a basic flip-top snack cup in various colours. I like the see-thru functionality so I don't have to guess if it's empty and what else may be in there. The problem is that the lid is easy to flip open. You can't just expect to dump this in your bag/baby bag without fear that the contents will scatter inside sooner or later. Then there is the see thru plastic that dents easily. The cup pressed against something inside the bag and there is a permanent dent on it effectively making it look even cheaper. It doesn't help that the feel of the plastic part is also cheap to touch. It's not like the OXO products I know. I hope this is not indicative of where OXO is headed. I don't use it to hold the snacks. I just dump objects in there like a pacifier for my baby. I really can't recommend this product unless they make improvements.",
				67: "This bag is great! My son is a little over 7 months. We had continued to swaddle him b/c w/o swaddle he would wake himself up every hour or so. Pedi recommended eventually tring a sleep sack. After reading numerous reviews, I decided to try this one. The 1st night he got up 1x. The 2nd night he slept 9.5hours. I was sold! Other nights he has been up 1 to 2.times each night, but he is sleeping and no longer swaddled. I think he was so used to being swaddled, sleeping w/o anything was impossible. My son is about 22lbs, almost 30inches long and the medium s perfect, plenty long. i find the sizing generous. Hope it holds up well, we r gonna need this for awhile! Super soft. Plenty wars w/ long or short sleeved onesie ynderneath for Nor Cal cool evenings. Baby boy is suEr happy sleeping unswaddled! Yippee! I had been dreading this day!",
				68: "I'd like to dock it another 1/2 star due to not being able to find out country of origin.  The company references using Asian factories on its website without specifying where exactly.  Since organic certifies a non-toxic production process without testing toxins already present in inputs like soil and water or testing the end-product, knowing where the cotton was grown is pretty important in a situation like this where the goal is to eliminate toxins next to baby's skin--especially since some parts of Asia are so polluted that an organic cotton product there could be more toxic than one grown conventionally elsewhere (still also very toxic).  And it is true that it is too thin to be useful on its own.  However, we've gotten a lot of use out of it by cutting the newborn diapers baby has outgrown down to soaker size and adding them to these as a liner.  Able to use with a snappy and less bulky than the cloth-eez prefolds in small that we're also using now, though those leak less often (still minimal enough with both).",
				69: "There is a reason this carrier is way cheaper than others. The comfort and quality just isn't there. It can work fine, but gets very uncomfortable fast. If you're only planning on wearing it for 10 minute stretches then you're fine. And for what ever reason, the waist belt is not attached to the carrier making you have to thread it through the every time (it always comes out when you're taking off or putting it on). The padding on the waist belt also isn't attached to the belt itself and will come off which is even more of a pain. These two features are bad enough it deal with but are exacerbated when also having to deal with a baby at the same time. Then the quality of the rest of the carrier is just way lower than the more expensive carriers. I ended up putting this in the closet, sucking it up and making the more expensive purchase of the Ergobaby. I wish I had just done that to begin with instead of wasting more money trying to take the cheaper route in the beginning.",
				70: "The product is ok. It was fairly easy to assemble. The finish seems to mark easily. The item we received was slightly damaged. A piece of trim, normally stapled on, had come off. We were able to nail and glue the part back into place without there being an obvious repair. Since the damage was minor and we did not discover it until the product was nearly assembled we did not bother to return it. I purchased this product because I had bought the matching crib. The finish is nearly identical to that of the crib and the set looks good in the nursery. UPDATE- a few months after we starting using the dresser the handles started to pull off and have to be glued on. The drawers will not slide well if pulled slightly crooked. Also beware of dragging the dresser along light colored carpet as it will mark the carpet. Its still a functional dresser but I wouldn't buy it again unless there was a very good sale. Otherwise spend the money on something of higher quality.",
				71: "This bouncer seat is very comfortable and soft for baby but also very warm, so if you have a summer baby they might be sweating from the material and uncomfy.  Wide base makes me feel like its safer than the cheaper bouncers but like everyone else said, toes of all ages in the house will be repeatedly stubbed. The bunny ear \"pillow\" does not come off for washing, but its connected by a piece of fabric that lets you adjust it several inches higher as baby grows.  Bunny \"body\" cushioning does come off for washing. Hanging birds don't seem to thrill, you can hang your own baby toys with plastic links. I love that I can use my foot to bounce baby at the base, the cheaper fisher price bouncer we have is too \"stiff\" for my foot to bounce it.  A true gender neutral product and was much easier to carry than I thought it would be.",
				72: "This monitor is terrible.  I have a previous mobi monitor for my daughter who is now almost 3 years.  (We still use it since she's in a bed and we like to keep an eye on her-that one is great and they have stopped making that version).  This Mobican DL monitor I'm using for my newborn.  It has frozen twice, which is 2 times too many.  When it freezes the screen shows her image (sleeping in the crib) but I can hear her screaming hysterically in the house.  This monitor is worthless.  It is not helpful at all if it freezes.  Besides freezing it makes very loud &#34;feedback&#34; noise.  In addition, it's very easy to &#34;de-synch&#34; the monitor by pushing the buttons on the side-that's not a fun thing to happen in the middle of the night.  I'm sorry.  I love my previous mobi video monitor this one is just no good.",
				73: "I bought these to freeze some of the foods I have been making for my daughter. The size is nice, and the containers stack easily in the fridge. I have two complaints. First, sometimes it is difficult to get the lids to snap on tightly on the first try. I have to hold the container and look to make sure all of the edges actually snapped down, even when I hear the sides &#34;click&#34;. Second, the containers are hard to grasp straight out of the freezer, because they usually have a light layer of frost on the sides. I have to let them thaw a few minutes on the counter, then use a towel to hold them when I take the lid off, otherwise they slip in my hand. Overall, the containers do the job they are supposed to, it just takes a little bit of effort to open and close them.",
				74: "I am a petite, 5'3\" person, and was looking for a smaller body pillow that wont take up half the space on my queen bed. After comparing reviews for this and theLeachco Snoogle Total Body PillowI decided to give this one a try. At the same time, i also bought the leachco from a local store for comparison. Immediately after it arrived, i noticed that the color was too dull for my liking. Once i took it out the package, i also noticed that the cloth was kind of rough. The filling also seemed to be of poor quality. Most importantly, sleeping with this wasnt any more comfortable than sleeping with a regular pillow.Bottom line, if you are looking for a real body pillow, this might not be the answer. Yes its cheaper than other versions, but you might be better off just using your regular pillow rather than spending money on this one. I ended up returning this one and keeping the leachco.",
				75: "I am so disappointed with this cart cover, my friend had a buggy bagg that was amazingly padded, when I ordered this one, I thought I would be getting the same quality, but no!  this cart cover has no sufficient padding!!  The package also didn't look new. For $50 I expected more! Should have bought the one I saw at Ross for $15!!!  I'm sure it would have been the same quality. Update: I just went to the Buggy bagg website - this product is the JR bag, which has no pillows, no padding, just a cover fabric - should cost $15 in my opinion.  In order to get the good one with the real padding as seen IN THE PICTURE BY THE SELLER AND AMAZON - you need to order the Elite one or the original. But, how could I have known this before? I didn't know that there are a few types of covers and the picture is misleading!!!!!THERE IS NO PILLOW OR EXTRA PADDING WITH THE JR COVER! THE COVER IN THE PICTURE IS NOT WHAT YOU ARE GETTING!",
				76: "I have this in a box ready to go back to Amazon. <br>Pros: Has voice activation (VOX) Has a charging cradle<br>Cons:The video is unacceptable - black and white, blurry, choppy and pixelated.  SHAME ON LEVANA for showing a clear color photo in their advertising and packaging. VOX is wonky.  It activates when baby is silent (thus waking me up for no reason at least six times a night) and sometimes does not activate until baby has been screaming for some time. Battery lasts 45minutes to 1 hour max, and does not beep to warn you that it is powering off.  So you will sit there thinking everything is OK when it is not.<br>Customer service - non existent. Your only option is to return your crappy monitor to Levana, where they have 6 weeks to repair it.  What are you supposed to do for 6 weeks??<br>In sum: AVOID until Levana spends some cash on product testing.  As it stands right now, this product is GARBAGE.",
				77: "I love these diapers. They fit my newborn and are still fitting her now at 7 weeks. She is 9lbs, 11ozs. I think we'll probably get another couple of weeks out of them. They have been very easy for me to begin cloth diapering as a first time mom. Because they're an all in one, you just throw them into the diaper pail. If you're breastfeeding, there's no rinsing required, just throw them into the washer. They take a little longer to dry (in order to get the thick absorbent core really dry). My daughter, my husband, and I have been very pleased. The snap down for the umbilical cord was very nice while we needed it too. I'm so happy I chose the Lil Joeys instead of using disposables for the first few weeks. My daughter's diaper area skin is super healthy. No redness or rash. Love our Lil Joeys!",
				78: "I have it on my daughter as an ankle bracelet becaause I am too scared to put it on her as a necklace.  Scared that maybe one of the kids at the sitters might pull it or soemthing else happen with it.  Even doubled up it is a little big on my 9 month old's ankle.  But with it being winter and her wearing socks it isn't an issue.  By this summer I would think her ankles with thicken up a bit and wearing socks with it won't be an issue.  My daughter seems to be drooling just as much, but not bothered by the pain of her teeth as bad.  She has gone from waking up 3-4 times a night to just once at midnight to be nursed and she is only up 5-15 minutes.  I have to say it works...but I am too scared to take it off to see if anything changes. Update: I took it off and my daughter is still the same.  Seems that it didn't work.  Only teething tablets & tylenol are working for all her teething coming in.",
				79: "We bought this because I assumed new model= new and improved. The lowest setting is so tall that my 4 month old's legs needs to grow at least 3 inches before he can touch the base. He is in the 75th percentile for height and weight. Seat padding is cheap feeling with no quilting or softness. The head rest part of the seat is supported by a thin piece of low density foam that falls backward because the stitching is too loose. If I had seen this in a store I would have bought a different model. I have only had this for 2 days and cannot write a more detailed review, but wanted to warn others of how high this is. UPDATE: Baby is now 10 months old and feet have only touched bottom on lowest setting for 2 months. This is by far the least stimulating toy he has and he screams when I put him in it. It also makes a cracking screech noise when he does jump. By far the worst design yet for an exersaucer. It is cute but that is the only compliment I have after owning it for 6 months.",
				80: "I bought this because my baby was kicking up a storm and of course it looks adorable... the issues I have with it are 1) the mat is paper thin - no padding so you'd have to put it on carpet or a blanket, 2) the pieces don't connect well- the yellow arch never stays up and connected to the mat, and the forget the piano 3) inherently, your kiddo is laying down so if they actually kick the thing, they can't see it, 4) if you're thinking you'll just use it as an activity mat - again it's really thin and the toys are kinda boring...I just think if your babies like to kick, let them kick on their own and save your money for either a good activity mat or a fun little piano when they can sit up - the mixing of the two on this is really not well designed/well worth it.",
				81: "Bought this for my daughter when she had her second baby.  She had a monitor without a picture for her first.  I convinced her that this would be better.  She couldn't agree more.  When we have the baby overnight we love watching him sleep.  I'm sure when he gets older it will be great to watch him wake up, or not.  With the picture you can see if the baby is just moving around, ready to get up, or has a foot or arm hanging out of the crib.  With the monitor you don't have to crack the door and check, thus usually waking the baby!  Glad I talked her into this monitor.  The picture is clear and has great features, like the &#34;going to sleep&#34; feature, as well as a cord AND batteries.  I'm sure she (and grandma) will get lots of use out of this monitor.",
				82: "I don't have enough good things to say about this high chair. I'm not generally a huge fan of all things Bjorn, but this is one well thought-out chair! I cannot even imagine how much of a headache it would be to clean a chair with multiple or creviced surfaces! This tray is so easy to clean, you can literally count seconds before it's as good as new. The belt is a bit harder to wipe, but that's no reason to complain. As for the size, it does LOOK small. But our 10-month-old son is in the 85 percentile and there's still room for him to grow on the medium setting. My understanding is that babies should not be growing fatter or wider after a certain age, so that should not pose a problem, but we'll see. So far this thing has been our favorite baby accessory for 4 months.",
				83: "I love this water pot, it's so handy! Heats up to the perfect temp super fast and stays there. Yeah, you have to clean it with a bottle brush, but that's not a big deal to me. I clean it about once a week. My biggest complaint, and I think the fatal flaw, is the design of the spout. It causes water to flood out and make a mess once you tip it to a certain angle. So what we've done is keep a funnel and use that to catch some of the spill. We also keep a towel by it to mop up the mess. So those two things on my counter don't make me all that happy, otherwise I'd have given it 5 stars. This is especially needed when you're filling a slim neck bottle. Like a Lifefactory or a Dr. Browns. If they'd fix this issue, it would be PERFECT!",
				84: "There is a mat like this one but more expensive I had my eye on... luckily I opted for this cheaper version and I'm so thrilled I did. As far as changing mats this one really is worth it's weight in gold. Instead of buying a cloth changing mat which you have to buy covers for and regularly launder, this thing is cleaned in about 2 seconds with a wipe or two. Any leaks or blowouts have been easily removed from it's surface and my daughter seems pretty comfortable on it. She's a long baby and my only concern with this product is that she's fast getting to the point where she will be too long for it, and she's only 3.5 months at the moment.. I'm not sure if any other changing tables would be long enough, though. Overall, worth every penny. I use this thing almost every diaper change.",
				85: "This product is terrible- I would not recommend it. We bought this to use on our back windshield, to help my poor 4 month old son not have the sun in his eyes during our 1/2 hour morning drive. 1) We have a very small (old style Honda Civic) car.  When this was stretched to its largest size, it only blocked a tiny portion of sun. I can't imagine how ridiculous it would be in a larger vehicle. 2) More importantly, in a 20 minute drive we had to pull over 4 times to re-suction this to the window.  We almost ended up with a soaked passenger seat because the thing sounds like a gunshot when it flies off the window. 3)  We tried suctioning it without stretching it the whole way, and without stretching it at all, and it didn't make a difference, it still didn't stay put. All of that being said, we got our money back.",
				86: "This was a gift! When we got it my son wanted to play with it. He dropped it like 20 times the first day and it still works. It plays some great songs (like 6 different ones) and sounds, 3 different rotating projecting lens, and the projector tilts to adjust on the wall or ceiling. All of this was great and would have been useful when my son was a newborn. However my son is now 17 month old and to him this is just a great toy to play with. My son has a nighty routine and he can't sleep with any light on... I use a blacklight to check-in or change him.  So the only thing I would complain about is the Nightlight button... the button alone is as bright as a blacklight and can light up a room by itself. I think the button should only glow in the dark and the actual Nightlight provides a soft glow for nighttime check-ins and changes. I would love this when my son was a newborn... especially the heartbeat and white noise sound. I would recommend this for any new or soon-to-be moms.",
				87: "I have two &#34;Graco Pack 'n Play On The Go Travel Playard&#34;, and bought two of this &#34;Dream On Me 3&#34; Foam Graco Pack n Play Mattress&#34;--which fit perfectly. I like that the mattress has a vinyl cover over it for leaks and such, but it doesn't seem to make for a very comfortable sleep area for my babies. Also, it kind of made a crinkly noise when they would move around.The problem I have beyond this mattress is that I have trouble finding sheets that fit. I've ordered &#34;Luvable Friends Fitted Pack n Play sheets&#34;, and the only ones that fit perfectly were the &#34;Traditional Pink Print&#34; (this is the one with teddy bears dressed in a pink ballerina outfit). I ordered the &#34;American Baby Company 100% Cotton Value Jersey Knit Fitted Portable/Mini Sheet&#34; in Pink, and even though the sheet's really soft, it doesn't fit quite well. Also, because the mattress has the vinyl/plastic covering, I decided to get the &#34;American Baby Company Waterproof Quilted Cotton Portable/Mini Crib Mattress Pad Cover&#34;. The padding doesn't fit it perfectly, but when I pair it with a fitted sheet--voila! Perfect sleep area for my babies.",
				88: "I almost didn't purchase this one due to the reviews about chunky babies not fitting the leg holes. My daughter has chunk legs but she seemed fine going in. It's a little snug to get her out but it's a nice walker. If her legs didn't fit i was going to cut the top of the leg hole to make the opening bigger.  The piano on top is fun and she likes to push all the buttons. The board has two sound volumes. Its not that loud and you can block it out. Once my daughter figured out that it moves, she is walking all over the place. She did 5 laps around the house. It does come with breaks, although i didn't put them on due to all of our stairs have doors that stay closed going downstairs.  I can always put them on later if i need to. It has three heights that you can adjust and lock. Now she has the ability to chase me down if she can't see me. Easy to put together too.",
				89: "SOOOOO much better than the original ones! Anytime I fed a baby with the originals I had to be prepared for the milk to pour out of the ring. We have not had one leak with these. We have used these with our twins who came home at 3 pounds 15 ounces and 5 pounds 5 ounces. Our smaller twin used them well for a couple days then had a lot of leakage out the sides of his mouth. We went back to the hospital preemie nipples until he was closer to 6 1/2 pounds and now does fine. I don't like that the cap doesn't seal. When warm their bottles (expressed breast milk) in a bowl or cup of hot water and if the bottle falls over the cap fills with water. This also means if the nipple were to leak in the diaper bag it would all come out the cap and trash the bag. Since I know this I just make sure the bottles are always upright in the cup holder.",
				90: "Wanted to use this to monitor my dogs when their outside so I can control barking if they start in the morning. But it doesn't have the range to do what we need to do, and there is a lot of interference even just a few rooms away. Our house is about 2000 sq ft but it has issues even just having it set up in the first bedroom and trying to walk outside. Was hoping we could use this when our first baby is born in December so if I have to run outside to tend to something I can still keep an eye on the baby but it doesn't seem to like to go through walls. It also cuts out a lot ... so if your playing music, it will every once in awhile cut out the picture/music and then start up again. Doesn't seem to have any reason why it occassionally does this. Works okay if you have low expectations but I would not buy to watch my newborn.",
				91: "well, i don't know how good the uppababby vista one is. (city versa is almost same model as uppababy vista) i've been use this stroller for over 3 months. I'm pretty sure this stroller is as good as the other one. (i've looked at the youtube video) this stroller maneuver so nice and easy even though the roads around my house aren't that great. i can go in and out of the door without help. i have the red one. it looks luxurious way more than it cost. when we're out in the public, almost all the time, people asks me about the stroller. (i live in small city, so i only saw graco, chicco, baby trend) folding is way easier than the handle turning thingy. i had a graco stroller that my friend gave me. that thing was so hard to close and open. finally, i gave up on that stroller cause it wouldn't turn anymore. Lucky me. i had a great deal with Amazon, too.only down part is...it's not compact stroller. if you have a small car, you will have only stroller in the car.",
				92: "This is made out of cheap feeling pieces of cardboard. The directions emphasize that your child is not supposed to touch these--and with good reason. I have no doubt that a strong infant could easily destroy these. I agree with another review that except for the clamp, this looks flimsy. I think it makes more sense to buy a mobile unit without worrying that an infant grasping one of the objects on the mobile can destroy it. My 6 1/2 month old grandson has a mobile made by Earlyears where the &#34;clamp&#34; is made of cloth with velcro straps and each of the mobile objects is sturdy enough for him to grab and squeeze them and even teeth on them. Tiny Tots is another excellent mobile maker. Bottom line: This may look nice but it's cheaply made. Buy something that your infant can grow into, i.e., when they get a little older they can grab the mobile and play with it.",
				93: "I had original purchased the Samsung SEW-3036 and it failed after 2 months, always beeping incessantly and losing its signal.  In April, I wrote a negative review on Amazon and two hours later, was contacted by the seller, on my cell phone.  He asked me to delete my review and he would send me a newer model, the SEW-3037.  This was against Amazon policy but I did it. This SEW-3037 was fine most of the time.  HOWEVER on two occasions so far, I was looking at the screen of my peacefully sleeping baby only to hear screams.  The monitor screen had froze on an image from earlier in the night. God only knows how long my baby had been screaming for me.And then this morning, it happened again.  I was actually getting worried (730AM and he is still sleeping!) until I heard the screams. Samsung needs to get its act together.",
				94: "These are crazy adjustable! I have mostly fuzzibunz as my favorite diaper for our son, now 16 months old. I bought these since sometimes we run low on diaper day, and wanted to try out something new (and get new colors, since FBs are pretty limited). I just can't help myself.Anyways, these are overall okay. I have to button the front adjustments to get them to not be too baggy. Which is fine. The insert that comes with it lasts up to 3 hours (like most non-hemp inserts) and washes fine. Gets a little static-y.BUT, my major complaint, is the inner plastic lining has come loose from the fabric! This hasn't happened with another Alva diaper (a flannel one in cow print) nor on any of my FBs that I've washed the same way for over 1 year. I've only had this a couple of months, and maybe it's been used a dozen or so times??? So definitely disappointed, should have just forked over 100% more for something that will actually last. In all: don't recommend.",
				95: "Unlike other options for when baby is dining out, this BPA-free tray is easy to transport, offers a clean surface to use, and snaps nicely together with a seal all the way around to contain any mess. The bright color is playful and having two divided sections allows you to keep wet and dry foods separate - at least until the little one starts digging in. I find the suction cups an added bonus that stick well on wood and other hard surfaces. They release easily when it is time to be packed up, yet time will tell how well the suction cups will hold up through multiple rounds in the dishwasher (top rack). This tray is much more appealing to me for meals out than using a flat placemat that I then have to figure out how to get back home after use and certainly easier than having a small dinner plate that I have to try to keep on the table. Overall, it seems well-designed and durable and at a favorable price point.",
				96: "The best part about this product is that I can sleep in my bed again after spending a week sleeping on the couch next to my newborn as he snoozed away in his sling.This thing has been amazing since the first moments we got it. My baby has reflux issues and will ONLY sleep on an incline. It fits next to my bed. The cover is WASHABLE - we've only had it a week and I've already had to wash it (poo!)The cover is easy to take on and off - it is a little tight around that vibration box thingie on the side but not frustrating.  It came out perfectly clean.I was worried that the fabric wouldn't be soft - I was worried it would be that awful, slick type fabric but it isn't! It is really soft. My baby loves it and therefore so do I. :)",
				97: "This is a NON-plastic large zippered pouch with two compartments.  Both are waterproof.  It is marketed to mothers of small children and yes, great idea.  Those blowout diapers or wet pants have to go somewhere until they get home.  This bag is perfect for carrying a change of clothing, clean cloth diapers (or disposable) or anything at all, and also provide a place for wet items.This would also work for anyone who needs to carry a wet swimsuit, smaller wet towel, etc.  It's a good size.  It would work for going to the gym for a workout.  Sweaty socks, t-shirts, stinky sports bra.  You name it.  Unless it was full-sized garments (like sweatpants or sweatshirt) this bag would work. Even though it is covered in kiddie cartoons I will be using mine for camping and fishing. Fabric is coated but feels like satin.  No weird vinyl smell.",
				98: "If your infant was born with any health issues which have you concerned about breathing, this Levana vibration monitor is an excellent purchase.  It is quite small and clips on easily, and sends out an alert if it recognizes 20 seconds of no movement (it vibrates gently at 15 seconds of no movement).  The nice thing is that it recognizes very small breaths that you would unlikely see on a fuzzy baby monitor.  The company also makes a cheaper version that does not offer the vibration feature. However, if you have a perfectly healthy baby and are prone to anxiety, this device might cause you a lot of extra grief.  On the other hand, if you are just using it for added piece of mind, it's a neat invention that is supposed to be more reliable than the under the mattress monitors. You may also be looking at the Snuza monitor.  Levana actually purchased the technology from Snuza and the products will now be released as Levana products.",
				99: "The Mombo Deluxe has proven to be an invaluable tool when it comes to feeding the baby (either nursing or bottle feeding).  Back and shoulder pain from prolonged feedings have been greatly reduced thanks to the support it provides.  Because it has a firm side (the soft side seems to be very comfortable for the baby to rest against), the pillow has been an effective tool in allowing the baby to be propped upright for proper digestion after feedings and for napping.  The vibration option (you do have to provide your own battery) has been effective; we&#8217;ve noticed a difference when we don&#8217;t use it, as it seems to have a calming effect.  As the baby gets older and begins to sit, this pillow will also be able to provide great support and protection from possible tumbles.  Aesthetically, the design of our pillow is very pleasing and gender-neutral (sage green and white, with elephants of varying colors).  The material is very easy to clean as long as you wipe it up quickly (purchasing a cover might make the most sense if you&#8217;re having to clean it often).",
				100: "I have used Levana monitors for years now. They are nearly indestructable. I know, I've dropped prior models numerous times, even down the stairs and they have held up. And as my children have grown, triplets, and gained the ability to be destructive, my old Levana was used by them like a football. After my sister had her first child, I wanted her to invest in one as well. But she's still in some mode were she needs to the &#34;best&#34; mom ever, a title that has never existed. To save her sanity, and her husband's, I watch their baby on the weekends. And the one item that is a necessity to me? The Levana. I'm not as young as I used to be, so I crank the volume up, place it right in my eye-line on the nightstand and I am prepared. What I would like to point out, sound quality is great but picture quality is flawless. My husband even remarked on how clear it is. One issue, getting the battery in there was not an easy task. I'm going to chalk it up to me being a bit rusty.",
