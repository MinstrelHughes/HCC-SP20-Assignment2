        <h2>Help us to count objects in pictures!</h2>

        <div>
            <p>
                Here are some objects on the pictures that need to be identified by human intelligence!
            </p>
            <p>
                Our pictures may contain a certain number of animals, humans, vehicles, or other objects.
            </p>

            <p>Here are the procedures: <br>
            <ol style="font-size: 16px;">
                <li style="margin: 10px 0;">Count how many objects indicated by the instructions.</li>
                <li style="margin: 10px 0;">Report your result as an integer in the text input area.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p id="markerGroup">
                By the way, <b class="red">click on the picture</b> and you will be able to mark it on the picture. <br>
                The marker is a <b class="red">small red dot</b>.
                How many tags do you have on the picture now will be updated below the picture.
                <br>We hope this marker system can help you to count.<br>
                You can also use the <b class="red">"Clear" button</b> to remove all markers and re count.
            </p>
